Paige Boet,Jun-23,New Orleans to London,1.0,The airline lost my luggage,"The airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip. They gave me no updates, their website sucks, and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone. They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to the US. Now, I’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me. They appease me on the phone, tell me they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up. Several times, when I called I got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call back later”.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,New Orleans,London
S Layne,Mar-23,London to Amman,1.0,fully refunded by our travel insurance,"We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,London,Amman
Joel Burman,Jun-23,Amman to London,4.0,WiFi didn't work ,"You can buy sandwiches and crisps but don't expect a hot meal. Because the plane is a narrow body , there are no screens.

M King,Jun-23,London to Washington,1.0,Communication is terrible,"Absolutely horrible airline. Communication is terrible. Last minute delays, cancellations, seat changes with no communication.

Carol Willmore,Jun-23,London to Funchal ,1.0,flight failed at every level,This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available. I would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,London,Funchal 
Nadine Kohler,Jun-23,Marseille to Seattle via London Heathrow,1.0,BA refuses to make it right,"Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right. So beware potential travelers!",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Marseille,Seattle via London Heathrow
A. Adel,Jun-23,Cairo to London ,2.0,shame for such well known airline,I flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat. Horrible service. I get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flight. Finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate.

Cosmin Stefanescu,Jun-23,Bucharest to Dallas via London,1.0,Total garbage,"I flew with numerous airlines, but I gotta admit, British Airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support. I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got. They don't have a live chat just like American Airlines do, they don't have a online form to submit your questions, they don t have a working international number.

Emmeline Reichert,Jun-23,Gatwick to Venice,3.0,arrived at the airport only 1 hour before,"We were traveling as a family (5 people). Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight. The kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in. The lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass. Because we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t figure out what was wrong. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party. The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,Gatwick,Venice
Jamie Gooding,Jun-23,Dublin to London City,1.0,so callous and uncaring,Flight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No text message. No phone. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. Hang on? What’s this! It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called. The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.!

Michael Hayward,Jun-23,Tokyo to Manchester via Heathrow,1.0,uncomfy old planes,Terrible. I have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights.

K Pickering,Jun-23,Seattle to Nice via London,1.0,I will never fly British Airways again,"I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Seattle,Nice via London
M Johnson,Mar-23,Sydney via Singapore to London Heathrow ,4.0,All in all very disappointing,My husband and I booked seats within our premium economy booking. On both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served food. Each time they had run out of our choices. On one occasion I did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me. On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food.

V Samaras,Apr-23,Athens to Durban via London Heathrow,2.0,All flights without exception were delayed,"I went through three flights to reach my destination. All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they weren't prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't communicate properly with them. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. I contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn't address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me. 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline together though.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Positive,Athens,Durban via London Heathrow

We were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight.

It should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time.

Alex Martinez,May-23,Las Vegas to Venice,1.0,the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with,"My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

B Sherry,May-23,Dallas to Madrid via London,1.0,cancel your flight without notice,"Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again.

The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please!

As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food.

Michelle Morgan,Jan-23,Sweden to Los Angeles via London,1.0,lack of customer service,"I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me.

We paid extra to choose our seats. Since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought, they seated us in totally different seats. I asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight. From London to LAX was worse, nobody in the airport help us. Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel.

T Cayle,Mar-23,London to Denver,1.0,trained to give you the runaround,Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Denver
Andrew Pybus,Apr-23,Hong Kong to London,3.0,they only had one choice of meal,"Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.

They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend.

C Maire,Jan-23,Madrid to Belfast via London,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience,"Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it.

Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room.

I called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only).

L Garson,Mar-23,New York to London,3.0,how far the quality level has slid,"I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them.

Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone.

No one able to help at LHR, said to use the app. Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA's fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres.

The flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok, the flight back was in a plane that should not be used. Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button.

R Worton,Mar-23,London Heathrow to Munich,1.0,a horror show of incompetence,"The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London Heathrow,Munich

It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

What let BA down was the food, it really was not nice, the IFE could do with some more content but that's not really a huge issue.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,Islamabad,London

We had booked our flight and car with BA Holidays. Unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to Madrid. I tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get help. The first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn't know that, she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else, that we had to call that number. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. I did reach out to another staff , a lovely young lady called Althea. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. They didn't charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to Madrid. Without the support of the lovely Althea, her professionalism, her care for us, we would not have make it.

M Wilson,Jan-23,London to Buenos Aires,2.0,catalogue of errors and inconveniences,"Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Negative,Negative,London,Buenos Aires

I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,['may'],Negative,Negative,London,Vienna

Reyes Diaz,Jan-23,London Gatwick to Alicante,2.0,need to cancel the ticket and rebook,"As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,London Gatwick,Alicante

But the two ladies on the desk were like no. No empathy there at all-saying the other guy shouldn’t have let me and they will have a word with him ?

Sam Hassan,Apr-22,London Heathrow to Athens Greece ,3.0,I find BA incredibly tacky,"I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones.

My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat.

Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team.

D Bartul,Dec-22,Vancouver to Delhi via London,1.0,felt misguided and misinformed,"Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,"['Dec', 'Dec', 'may']",Negative,Negative,Vancouver,Delhi via London

I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience.

Richard Cowling,Nov-22,London Gatwick to Cancun,2.0,Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience,"Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew.

I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up.",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,Heathrow,Tenerife

We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered.

Christine Chapman,Jun-22,London to Barcelona,1.0,not worth the risk of travelling with BA,"Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers.

When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. Also when I made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. British Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion.

T Payne,Jul-22,Edinburgh to Washington via London,1.0,get us on a flight 5 days later,"My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

Rene Verhoef,Jun-22,Vancouver to Amsterdam via London,1.0,refund process is non responsive,"Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands.

James Pang,Apr-22,Hong Kong to London,1.0,"BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it","BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022.

Simon Fowler,Jun-22,Portland to London,4.0,food choice and quality was poor,"This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor.

However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset.

The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone).

But his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached Toronto in time. We are thankful to British Airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son, especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic.

F Keele,Feb-22,Zurich to London,1.0,finally agreed to refund my baggage charge,"As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Positive,Zurich,London

I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund.

R Marton,May-22,Columbus to Nairobi via Chicago / London,1.0,They actually give me a voucher,"BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me.

The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline.

After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document.

I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking.

If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor.""

There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move.

We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed.

My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris.

Shaun Woodard,Mar-22,Austin to London via Dublin,1.0,There is no customer support,"Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy.

C Layne,Mar-22,London Heathrow to Funchal,4.0,I couldn’t check in online,"We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time.

S James,Feb-22,London Heathrow to Cairo,1.0,Ryanair has more finesse,"One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket.

I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen.

Graham Law,Feb-22,London to Edinburgh,1.0,could not rebook via BA’s website,Another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service. The day after Storm Eunice and English half term holidays are getting underway. So you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight. Some BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Edinburgh

The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although I did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected).

M Peale,Feb-22,Montréal to Dubai via London,10.0,such a nice employee,"I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, I’ll definitely make sure to check with British airways first.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,Montréal,Dubai via London
Thomas Scrivens,Nov-21,New York to Newcastle via London,3.0,I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday,Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Positive,New York,Newcastle via London
Sonto Mtolo,Jan-22,Durban to Cape Town,10.0,staff was very kind and friendly,"I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,Durban,Cape Town
G Thanidhar,Jan-22,Bangalore to Detroit via London,1.0,complete disregard for your passengers,"I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!",Solo Leisure,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Bangalore,Detroit via London
C Heale,Jan-22,New York to London,3.0,decline into a sub-par service,"I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,New York,London

M Kalsiman,Oct-21,London to Dubai,1.0,doors cannot close till take off,"Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,London,Dubai

The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.

When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount.""

L Deane,Jul-21,Singapore to London,1.0,"whole experience was stressful, costly","I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,Singapore,London

G Bartakovics,Aug-21,Mykonos to New York via London,1.0,stupidity of this whole situation,"I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.",Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Mykonos,New York via London
M Himer,Sep-21,Boston to Tirana London,1.0,lost the connecting flight to Tirana,"My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. We were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for.

F Jackson,Aug-21,Washington Dulles to London ,1.0,service on the same route is becoming worse,"Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,['may'],Negative,Negative,Washington Dulles,London

You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone.

R Marston,Aug-21,London to Athens,10.0,value for money here is incredible,I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class. Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,['may'],Positive,Positive,London,Athens

I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. I went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. And there was no one to ask. Just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me.

When I booked a single ticket from Canada to India, how come they didn't realise I couldn't fly? No refund at all. Gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but I don't have any travel plans for the next two years. That means my money is gone? When talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'Onetravel'. The worst experience ever with an airline.

My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant.

But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines!

I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled.

I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February.

I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight.

If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced.

E Partani,Mar-20,Sydney to London via Singapore,1.0,never use this airline again,"I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.

BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to 'phone them.

Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane.

I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. They declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund. The calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes.  BA standard of service compared to the other major European airlines was dishonest and obstructive.

But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services. I spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online.  I set up conversations Facebook and Twitter, they went unanswered. On the second day of my telephone ordeal I actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line. When this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting I managed to blurt out my Ref number, nothing else… before that call was disconnected. Thankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight. This change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails. But the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected. The only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company.

I then checked the FCO website that was also updated on 17 March and it states: ""The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel to Spain."" So it is clear that BA deem it ""safe"" to fly to Spain despite the FCO statement. I know the airline is suffering, like the rest of UK industry and business, but how can they get away with such deceitful practices.

However, BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger's are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic location.

Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between.

I Polson,Nov-19,London to San Francisco,3.0,find an alternative airline,"London to San Francisco return in Economy. The seats are small. Outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible. I'm only 5'5 and female but couldn't lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible.

W Lang,Oct-19,London to Cape Town,1.0,downgraded to premium economy,"London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.",Business,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Neutral,London,Cape Town

I have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying, everything on the plane was fine. After the flight landed, I rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and I had another flight out of London and only had an hour to make it. Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. Hoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand. It ended up costing my wife and I almost $3000 for new tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the airport and British Airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher.

Finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our ""no show"" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated.

I come to find that the minimum layover time in London is 1 hr. My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. British Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total lie. My wife and I were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. We had the same route in the reverse direction. I called BA hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. They kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. British Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something.

This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28.

K Thayne,Sep-19,London to Dublin,1.0,don’t know which airline is at fault,"London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London,Dublin

Arriving at HK airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel??).

Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish.

I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not.",Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,London City,Amsterdam

Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help.

On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

The bags did not arrive and we spent two days in London without our bags. I left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claim. Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothing.

H Lind,Aug-19,London Heathrow to Inverness,1.0,Utterly appalling,"London Heathrow to Inverness. Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling.

H Lind,Aug-19,Inverness to Vancouver via London,1.0,awful experience from beginning to end,"A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,Inverness,Vancouver via London

My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses.

Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me.

I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this.

The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats.

We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking.

No privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. The food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. Breakfast had no jam with the croissant. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves out. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it.

J Meares,Apr-19,Bucharest to London,1.0,no longer getting compensated,"Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,Bucharest,London

The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class.

The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service.

Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty.

I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points.

This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag. I asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included.

The crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal.

C Dean,Mar-19,Tenerife to Heathrow,2.0,Effectively a budget airline,"Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,Tenerife,Heathrow

However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal.

Preslava Eneva,Feb-19,Amsterdam to London,2.0,overall experience was terrible,"I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it.

I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding.",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,London,Milan 
D Thomas,Jan-19,New York to London via Geneva,2.0,British Airways customer review,"New York to London via Geneva with British Airways. The plane was late, not an issue. But some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner, they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly. On a 7 hour flight, they served us the food 40mins after departure, then 20mins at the most after started clearing, we were not even close to finish eating. Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. This was really poor service. Especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us.

During this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it.

On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather.

Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking?

My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome.

The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him.

This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD.

When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off.

The plane itself was old, I found the  food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back, had to be checked in for security purposes. This meant that when I was at Ataturk airport we had no less than 3 separate security checks. 1 before check in, one after check in and one before getting on the plane. Because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the plane. Norwegian offers free wifi so I could check my phone on the plane.

At the passport/visa check desk, presented printed boarding pass to the BA lady - my wife was holding the passports. The lady looked at the boarding passes and barked 'Passports' as if she did not see my wife holding them. Second bark: 'Do you have a visa?'. Third bark: 'Show me'. Fourth bark: 'Next'. No smile, no 'Hello' or 'Good morning'. Hardly any eye contact either. If anything, the situation was worse at boarding. BA recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. All such systems need to be policed, but there are ways of policing the arrangements. Some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. When caught by the gate keeper, they were told, 'Not Yet'. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,London,Istanbul

It was outrageous of British Airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when I checked in at LHR on the 05/07. I bought, paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date. How dare BA do this to me when I was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work (different airlines) until I encountered BA at Heathrow. Check-in and help desk are arrogant, rude and are as miserable as hell. Not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a £5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat. we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from BA. British Airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the Heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, they are wrong, like others I have found an alternative airline.

I understand I can pay to get a seat I want but other than having a seat next to my husband I don’t want any particular seat. We are travelling as a pair. There are three seats each side of the aisle. There will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit.

They could have just got more staff there to begin with. Group boarding was super slow. Inside the econ cabin, the plane seemed very old, and worn-out. The entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn't inform the customers about it. Some of the flight attendants were unprofessional.

No co-ordination at airport and apparently not one BA manager at Rome airport who I could speak to. Had to call BA customer service in UK which was a waste of time. Given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. Failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. Advised stewardess but they did not care. Could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat. Waste of time paying to go business class with BA.

I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew BA for this trip.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Positive,Mumbai,Edinburgh via London

I've flown economy and premium economy before, found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. I had one person ask if I needed anything who then brought me the tea I requested. The staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money.

As an alternative They rerouted me on a night flight to Madrid, then to Palma, to arrive the next day in Birmingham. Disappointed of the disservice I called the customer service in England (and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator) and I was offered a flight in the evening at 1900, which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined. I had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to London in time, unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune. On top of it, since the flight would arrive no longer at Heathrow but at Stansted, I had to pay the taxi £70 more than the agreed amount if I arrived at Heathrow. British Airways did not take responsibility, I was not reimbursed the new flight I had to book last minute nor the taxi difference. They did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused.

Marsha Sheldon,May-18,Los Angeles to London,1.0,no one to solve problems,"Los Angeles to London. I booked with AA, LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. They have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors, no results. There is no one to solve problems.

I understand that it isn't the flight attendants fault,  but it would have been nice if a little more effort than 'there's nothing we can do' was given to the issue! On the flight from Gatwick to Tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 30-40 minutes as the bridge 'wasn't where it should be' which once again wasn't the worst problem In the world but after a long flight isn't particularly what you wanted!

The toilet hadn't been cleaned properly before boarding, and during the flight, one of the two washrooms became unusable, resulting in long queues.

I was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines. The line we were moved to was substantially longer however I was patient. By the time I got to the desk, an hour had passed, and I had a bit over an hour left to my flight. I figured this was tight but all the while manageable since I trusted BA's system. The woman at the counter asked me where I was going and when I said Montreal, she looked at me and said ""you won't make it"". I explained the situation how I had been in the airport for several hours already and that I was in line for 1 hour. She just told me I needed to go to the missed flight counter. I got to the counter and they informed me that I had to buy a new return ticket. My original return ticket cost me $800, my return cost me $1350.  I had no choice but to buy the ticket. I also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to Gatwick airport the following morning. Once I arrived back in Montreal I called BA Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight I missed.

Also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system.

The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. Disembarkation was slow and badly managed. Nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers.

T Leane,Mar-18,London to Las Vegas ,2.0,"outdated, unclean and uncomfortable","London to Las Vegas. Disappointed at BA - flights were delayed (my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 2-3hrs). Aircraft interior was outdated, unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space. No safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this. Food was tasteless and I did skip a meal in the end - during one of the snack times we weren't given the options by our FA but the guy sat next to us who was served by another FA was given different options. Inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old. To ensure that I sit with my partner on the return flight, we paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke IFE box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor.

From the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptional. I was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door. Every person was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible. I witnessed such kindness and this is what I have come to expect and value from British Airways.

Once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not working. The cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. There was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. As it was a night flight, my wife and I had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. Any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. As BAs safety demonstration prior to take off is on video, we didn't receive this.

E Christie,Mar-18,London to Casablanca,2.0,extremely unprofessional,"London to Casablanca. Their customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchy. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. TAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flight. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. They were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of BA. This is very rude and extremely unprofessional.

During the dinner, I was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake. For the breakfast, the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals (up until 40 minutes before landing, they were still serving), I waited for my turn but no food came so I asked. Instead of them explaining and apologising, I had to ask where is my food. They said that they ran out of food, because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleep. The cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which I have filled in. While I understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and I liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need), it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours. Also, it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew (I thought they should have their own?).

As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. My only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very late. It was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. That kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. Toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. However, I wasn't impressed by the seats in BA flights. I found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia). I also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough.

I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their offer of compensation was £200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future.

We booked our flight tickets directly on BA site since July 2017 for the travelling date of December 24, 2017. One day before our travel, we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (BKK > LHR) without prior notice through any communication channels (email, sms text) by BA. After many attempts to find a solution, it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in Thailand. However, we managed to talk to the customer services team in UK. She informed us that due to the connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled by BA, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors). The assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the BKK > LHR flight if we (by ourselves) could find a connecting flight from LHR to LIS. The only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. Unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). Our intention is to seek for proper explanation from BA in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. We had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check-in online 24 hours before the flight. If we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date, we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled.  We were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but BA's neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. Finally, we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66% extra since it was a last minute ticket on Christmas eve. I find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. This event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip's spending, but left us with one of the worst flying experiences.

Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it.

All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. BA? Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Even Ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. It would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. So not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcase. Once we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with them). Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. Do not fly BA, save your money and go with a budget airline.

Our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. Cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn't have been in service. I agree. Flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. No assistance provided by BA. Told it wasn't there problem and sort my own accommodation out. Took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. Was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for. BA is now as bad as Ryanair so will never fly with them again. They're charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service.,Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Gatwick,Funchal

B Muller,Dec-17,London to Cape Town,3.0,I was sorely disappointed,"I flew Premium Economy from London to Cape Town on British Airways. Having flown Premium Economy before, I had certain expectations of what I would be getting, but I was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive Premium Economy I have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worst. The plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. From Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where I was constantly pushing against it. I finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. The personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones - the screen was tiny, the blind next to me could not be pulled down. The headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that I spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in, so that I could actually hear anything. Expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. I find it shocking that BA charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. I needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times, with no success, I phoned BA and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which I gave up and just cancelled the flight, which worked first time. I booked a flight on another airline and for just £200 more, I got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Negative,Negative,London,Cape Town

Then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes. Wonder what they do with the miles. The worst business class I have flown.

Francisco Massanet,Dec-17,London to Montreal,1.0,bad service with delayed luggage,"London to Montreal. Very bad service with delayed luggage. For some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. I was flying from London to Montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. First guy I talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. Were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something? In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to Montreal. But after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in Dublin. A second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. A couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, I decided to call them back again. This time my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them back, Monday morning London time, so I did. I called back again on Monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his London team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Don't they have all this info in file?. After telling him that I did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcase. Lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. I understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. I think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me. After this awful experience with their missing luggage department, I hardly doubt I will use British Airways again.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London,Montreal

We were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours (in high temperatures with no air conditioning - the passengers were all sweating) before the plane took off. Kept saying it would be 10 mins and then 15 mins. 2 hours odd later we finally took off. Economy on BA is horrible. Seats are uncomfortable, no space, can hardly get refreshments (the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water), food is bad. To make it worse, when we landed in London we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because BA didn't have a spare arrivals gate. Due to all the delays, we had to run like mad people to get from Heathrow to Gatwick in time for our onward flight with BA. Against all odds, we got their with 30 mins to spare (plane hadn't boarded yet) but they casually said we were too late and said we'd have to fly the next day.

Very limited selection and very dated equipment/screens. Plus they kept stalling. The staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum. We were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end. The food was average and I was very hungry throughout the service. As far as I am aware, on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible - I don’t call being starved very comfortable!

My flight kept being delayed for hours. After more than 4 hours delay, there was no point for me to fly to London anymore, as I had missed an important meeting. I was told that I will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation. After a few days I call their customer support to ask about the refund. They told me that I will get the refund within 7 days. After 4 weeks, I notice that they still haven't refunded me. It's very difficult to contact them. The phone hotline is only available until 5pm (Monday-Friday). They hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website. Once I managed to send them a message, I only get a reply a few days later telling me, that they can't reply to this case via email and that I should call. All I want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund. I take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times. After being on hold for a while, it turns out, they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hours. A very convenient mistake, to forget a 360€ refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiry. Only after I asked what compensation I will get for this, I was offered 5000 Avios points.

Raymond Grayson,Aug-17,Newcastle to San Francisco via London Heathrow,2.0,One issue after another!,"Flew Newcastle to San Francisco via London Heathrow with British Airways. One issue after another! The flight from Newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in London, we departed late. We should have had a two hour lay-over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to San Francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re-routed via Washington! Our booked flight to San Francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back. We finally got on the Washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from Amsterdam to catch the flight. The delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at Heathrow thus delaying the flight further. We eventually arrived in Washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight - there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available. Obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour (around about 23.00) trying to find help at the check-in desk in a practically empty airport. United (acting on behalf of BA) checked us onto a flight the following morning and the BA staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away. Ironically, the BA personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from Amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us! We were also downgraded to economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business class was full. We eventually got to San Francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival. BA offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down-grade in class. They did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre-booked (but unused) hotel in San Francisco. The airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibility.

We passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. I had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. At such an unsociable hour of the morning, I could no longer disturb her. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. On arrival, I was brusquely told by a BA rep to go online and find my own accommodation. After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. I was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where I should have been. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working). Also had I known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. Further wait. Not only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination.

We were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. The member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. For us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the Lake District the following day. We were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation.

We ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at London Heathrow and we would not arrive in Rome in the AM as planned. We decided to give it a shot regardless. We arrived at BWI and discovered we were not on an AA flight and had packed more bags than BA would allow. (We had three checked bags instead of 2 and British Airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). Luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. I can't say the same for the rest of our trip. We found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. The neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. We arrived into London around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. The BA representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. We again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in Rome. The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into Rome for dinner. Upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my PayPal account. We eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to London. Once we arrived at Rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). Upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. Luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. Otherwise I imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. We are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from Rome to London.

Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. I got on the plane and asked if I could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as I could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end.

The plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing. On this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff. Cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get, the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone. It's more akin to economy, also a real negative point is your at Heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses! A shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport. This flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit.

When I reached Phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in, then down to go through security again to board my flight.

It turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class: they had exactly the same width and pitch! Actually, British Airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain, and called this a business class! Moreover, our pre-flight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because British Airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in Victoria Falls.

Mubashira Bukhari Khwaja,Oct-17,London to Johannesburg,1.0,They were refused boarding,"Verified Review   I travelled to Johannesburg from London Heathrow on Sunday 22nd October on flight BA55 and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd October. They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to South Africa. There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking. Other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive, even though both my husband and I are frequent travellers and have Silver cards of their Executive program.

I arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that I could not check in. After a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up, I was told I can go on a different flight - the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning. So I missed a whole day's business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day. When I queried the fact that I was unable to board I was told that overselling the flight was normal - ""all airlines do it"". The fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation. I was casually advised to read the small print in the future. On the way back from my destination, in order to avoid the same thing happening, I decided to check in online 24 hours before. However, I was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by. Apparently, the return flight is overbooked again! I do not understand how it is possible that the product/service that I have purchased, I can not use. How can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that I have duly purchased a good 4 months in advance!!!! The disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge, inept company is beyond pale! On top of that, the company's decision to no longer serve coffee/tea and food on board is unacceptable.

My feedback seems to mirror many other users here - BA standards are just getting worse and worse, and I am talking about business class which I thought they would maintain? The cabin interior was worn and quite grubby, the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class. The meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy. Cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot. Chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting BA because of the fall in standards - I'm not surprised and I for one would not use them again for long haul.

If they continue to treat passengers this way I can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty. The reply I got from the airline below just brushed all the issues I raised under the carpet. Living in Egypt for 10 years I became I frequent flyer with Egyptair. If I wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me £60. BA want to charge me over £500 and because I wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £9.50 refund even though I would have given them over 2 months notice. This airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will I book another flight with BA. There was no priority seat booking unless I paid another £38 extra. There was no priority boarding. I booked seat 23D but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24E. BA emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was. I did not make any changes. In premium economy I was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1"" wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room. Is this some kind of joke? I had to double check that I wasn't in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row. The tough chicken meal was diabolical. The cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever. I really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway. I ended up paying £300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight. A few days previously I flew premium Economy with Virgin Atlantic return from Barbados and the difference between BA and Virgin is worlds apart.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Negative,Negative,Heathrow,Dubai
S Hammis,Oct-17,Gatwick to Marrakech,1.0,I will not use BA again,"Verified Review   Gatwick to Marrakech, the cabin crew was lazy and rude, refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds . For the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped. Half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu. The lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customers. After 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn’t finished serving other customers even though none of the 3 staff members was seen serving anyone. We waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored. After another 10 Minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving. We tried for over 1 hour to buy some Jaffa cakes which would have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask for. Ryanair or EasyJet Service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew. I will not use BA again if I can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline .",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Gatwick,Marrakech
K Chater,Oct-17,Shanghai to Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick,1.0,deplorable customer service,"Verified Review   Shanghai to Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick. We received deplorable customer service recently from British Airways. I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ). Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed on October 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160. We were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. Apparently British Airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Shanghai,Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick
Simon Fowler,Oct-17,Oakland to Heathrow,7.0,this flight was fine,"Verified Review   Oakland to Heathrow and this flight was fine. The worst that could be said is that there is no magic, that other airlines manage to provide. Left and arrived on time. FA attentive and professional.

V Mitov,Sep-17,London to Sofia,3.0,now becoming as bad as Ryanair,"Verified Review   London to Sofia. Cabin crew were kind. This is the only positive thing. British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days. When I pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that I get a 20% discount voucher from my next flight price, they said this is something British Airways do not offer.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,London,Sofia
S Kenton,Oct-17,Malaga to Gatwick,2.0,crew seem genuinely fed up,"Verified Review   Malaga to Gatwick. They've introduced new cabin baggage allowances. Ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like scuffle. They now charge for food. This would be fine if it didn't take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane. On my previous three flights with 'the new BA' we've been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any service. As the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets, there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane. On the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. The cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. One of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew service. This has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company, giving them no time (or energy, by the look of it) to be nice. Ultimately, if price is everything make sure you check Norwegian before you spend any money with BA. If price isn’t everything don’t fly BA.",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,Malaga,Gatwick
N Jeffery,Oct-17,London Heathrow to Nice,1.0,Deliberate extortion,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Nice. Deliberate extortion by BA in my opinion. I booked an economy basic return from Nice to London with BA. Days before the outbound I had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier. I ended up buying a new single outbound flight as BA app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight. In the UK I received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from BA. However app again gave up and said I had logged in too many times. Upon arrival at Heathrow I was told BA had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings. They said I had to pay approx £350 to buy a new single ticket home, even after I explained my situation. I argued that had I been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did I could have at least bought a cheaper flight. Even the day before when I got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper. Eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for £122 (charging me again for taxes). As i needed to get back and there was no time to go to Gatwick for cheaper flight I had no choice but to pay. Terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when I asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t&c he said he would not like to comment.",Business,Economy Class,['may'],Negative,Neutral,London Heathrow,Nice
K Lanson,Aug-17,London to Abu Dhabi,2.0,I won't fly with them again,"Verified Review   London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied ""can I check - you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window"". I replied yes. After a series of phone calls, the upgrade was processed (I paid 149 GBP). My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasn't for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. I've flown BA for years, but this year has been disappointing. I won't fly with them again.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Neutral,Neutral,London,Abu Dhabi
Paul Dreyfuss,Oct-17,London Heathrow  to Madrid,3.0,true case of rip-off BA,"Verified Review   London to Madrid in economy class. Late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from Heathrow. Online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay. Boarding quite efficient. Cabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. Everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. Staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. I wouldn't have minded on a cheap ticket, but this was not a true case of rip-off BA in 2017. Will avoid if possible.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Positive,London Heathrow ,Madrid

Then, on Monday, I was ordered to pay £65 (83 Francs). Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest, the supervisor particularly). Their customer service is also awful. It's a joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeks. They only responded when I chased them up, said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. Can you believe that? The explanation was their IT system failed in May 2017, an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,['May'],Positive,Neutral,Geneva,London

I can't comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the Atlantic Ocean, only allows 1 check in free bag for economy class. Upon returning to GCM from LON on October 6, 2017, I had to pay £290 for additional baggage.  Particularly for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good education.  In addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights? That was one of the things I appreciated most about BA as it made me feel valued. I am truly disappointed with BA these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to LON from GCM you guarantee I WILL abandon BA!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,Grand Cayman,London

Samuele Scagnetti,Sep-17,Geneva to London,1.0,now worse than Ryanair,"Verified Review   Geneva to London. British Airways used to be my favourite airline, however, over the last 2 years I have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights I have had with them. I do fly with BA about 30 times a year. In this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities) I was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind I was flying at 7am the morning after. Their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight. I must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy. When I managed to connect I have had to hold for an hour before the line died. I have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. Horrible customer service by the way, the person I was talking to couldn't care less. I was originally flying in business and I was placed in economy instead. I was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions (a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries) and promised a refund on the fare which to date (about 4 months later) has still not happened.

After reading reviews I was hoping some were inaccurate, but after this flight in Club World I realise that BA has fallen even lower than many have said. Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these.

Inflight entertainment not the best, but still acceptable. Short hauls don't have any screens. Only thing I don't like is the seats. Economy seats are small.

I am a one world emerald member on AA so I get certain perks when flying British Airways such as free seat selection, lounge use and priority boarding - that makes this airline bearable - just. They are obsessed with carry on bags much like Ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes - not sure what it does for them as it only increases their bag handling costs. Their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight. What used to set BA apart was their inflight service - even in coach a sandwich or something - this has degraded to nothing, zero - even a soft drink is charged. So I asked for water, I was offered an Evian for $5 - no thanks just plain water. Ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else. Of course he never came back - 2.5 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water.

Not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young baby. The language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisle. Especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible.

D Masiko,Sep-17,Gatwick to Mauritius,4.0,very poor and disappointing experience,"Verified Review   Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointing airline and service. The facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits, it's a mess. Why? Because you get other people stumbling on your feet during mid-flight. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleep every time they need to use the restroom? The TV monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting the brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time, good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. The worst thing was the food - salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partner's chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. I ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty.  And the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad.

The outward flight was delayed for an hour at San Jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals. On the flight I was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seat fully as soon as we took off, making it impossible to hold a book at reading distance and then jiggled and bounced as he watched the IFE - it would have been a miserable flight without a seat to move along to. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juice. The food was of good quality so it was, despite the delay, a good experience. On the return, boarding was swift and efficient, and the cabin staff, once again, friendly and helpful.

E Snowden,Jul-17,London to Keflavik,1.0,avoid at all costs,"Verified Review   London to Keflavik. British Airways lost one of my bags on our way to Iceland for a week long vacation. This is understandable, bags get delayed all the time. However, when I attempted to contact British Airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room, I was disconnected multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers. The delayed bag contained our sleeping bags and tent for a one week camping trip. Not knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels in Iceland cost upwards of $200 a night, we were forced to sleep in our rental car until the next day when we were able to rent a tent. Since making my claim for reimbursement, British airways has done everything in their power to avoid reimbursement. I have been told my partner who purchased the tickets must fax written permission for me to handle the claim even though the baggage was under my name, paid for by me, and all costs for tent rental and toiletry items were paid with my credit card.

S Ballimore,Aug-17,Florence to Bristol,10.0,positive first experience,"Verified Review   Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the future. When I booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. My criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,Florence,Bristol
Philip Hermon,Aug-17,Nice to Heathrow,1.0,downgrade rating of British Airways,"Verified Review   Nice to London Heathrow. You must downgrade your rating of British Airways if you truly reflect how bad things have become. Flight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality. Once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible. Aside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads (most unpleasant in a confined space), their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude. They seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us, and that is just not acceptable. Sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness. BA management should be fired, or at least the CEO, Mr Cruz, who is destroying our national airline.

E Salter,Aug-17,Toulouse to London Heathrow,2.0,cheap and sleazy budget airline,"Verified Review   Toulouse to London Heathrow. This airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier (it has to be said, no expense is spared on its branding) while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline, thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management. I have Bronze status with BA Executive Club, have flown a dozen times over the past year (both in Business and in Economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself that I chose to collect points with this particular airline. I was caught up in the IT meltdown in May (flying from Rhodes to London), and I was one of the lucky ones (who doesn't remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days?). I had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from Rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of other BA flights in May); this (incidentally: ghastly TUI) replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight I booked that I lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport, which the airline refused to refund when I lodged a claim. The airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight, along with EU compensation, after I sent a second email a month after my first claim, as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me, according to the customer agent. Their customer service is beyond atrocious. I suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for BA failings (all you get is ""bear with us, we're trying really hard""), lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability. I am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to Belfast, and after two calls to their contact center (based in India, with a poor connection and amateur communication overall) still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a Canadian citizen without a UK ID document. The customer agents I spoke to gave me contradictory answers, which, in turn, run contrary to the (almost non-existent) information provided on their website. On the flights I have booked which have actually taken place, I have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in BDX when the plane lost its takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would they admit this was their fault? Nope, it was all air traffic control's fault!), been held on the tarmac in TLS for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane, retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my Club seat (no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it), sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in Club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival.

S Tallouhe,Aug-17,London to Chicago,3.0,downgraded the ticket,"Verified Review   London to Chicago. I am a BA Gold member and reserved three BA business class tickets to Chicago returning from Denver. I selected contiguous seats so that my young daughters and myself would sit together. A week before departure, I received a message from BA informing me that our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day. On the departure date, we checked smoothly at the business class counter at LHR. The fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problem. The lounge attendant, however, curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes. I checked and it was true, but I had not suspected it at all till that point, since I had paid for business class, believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at check-in. The customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasn’t him who downgraded the ticket! I spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights, but they were all full. He could not confirm if BA had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade, he had no explanation for why BA did not give us any other option with business seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance, nor did he acknowledge that BA had made any mistake in this ordeal. However, he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation. We ended up traveling in economy class. To add insult to injury, the airline was unable to place us next to each other, so the family was split (seven rows apart). However, the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first. They almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Chicago

About 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight. It took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 (our row) there was no food left not even a Kit-Kat we had the last can of Coca Cola and a bottle of water. Several factors contributed to this silly situation : BA Trying to become a low cost airline (I did not realise that it had sunk so low when I booked). The fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay.  The blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling.

In fact, BA doesn't even have a representative in Budapest, having outsourced it to a Hungarian agent (who did their best in the absence of any input from BA). Even the customer service desk I phoned was answered from India (also outsourced). When the flight finally took off, we could not even buy food on the plane. We were told that a BA representative would meet us at our Heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers, but he / she wisely didn't show up, because I, for one, was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which I won't get back rather than some airport food vouchers.

I thought that because my Booking was with BA they should pay the excess which they refused to do.

After the whole episode, I wrote an e-mail requesting compensation for the flight delay & my misplaced baggage. It's now July 2017 and I still have not gotten back my monies. Extremely poor customer service. Wrote e-mails twice chasing them for the refunds. They said they will check. That was more than a week ago and haven't heard from them yet.

Arriving at Berlin check in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite that it contained fragile items. Another of my party did want to check in her hand baggage and was told no. Both times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and uncooperative .I was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat. The new seat configuration is so narrow now I could not get into the allocated seat as I have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get to the seat. Fortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat. I put a small plastic bag with fragile items in the overhead locker, the steward, without telling me or consulting me, moved it. When I queried this I was told ""Madam,  I know what I am doing I have done this before"". I am 71 years old and I refuse to be so patronised so I was ready for a stand up row by this time. Fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation. No food left at the back of the plane as usual. Why on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service?

N Tappin,May-17,Krakow to London,3.0,service has gone downhill,"Verified Review   Krakow to London. Got us there fine. My main issue is the food service. I was sat in Row 21, probably 3/4 of the way back. It was an evening weekday flight,so everyone tired & hungry. Their new M&S service was a disaster. The flight was just over 2 hours. It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. By the time it arrived all that was available was a KitKat and some other sweets! They had already run out of sandwiches / hot food. It took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card - and the machine seemed to keep on having problems. Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored). Have to say this services is no better than Easyjet & I will think twice about travelling with BA. If it wasn't paid for by work I would not have travelled with them. The service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Krakow,London
A Shuman,Jul-17,Venice to Gatwick,1.0,never going to choose BA again,"Verified Review   Venice to Gatwick. I am done with British Airways. It has the worst service and incredibly rude staff. We were supposed to fly back from Venice at 11.55 p.m on 10th July. The flight was delayed by an hour and a half. BA policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours. Fair enough. However, what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport. The only cafe at the VCE Airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 11.30pm. When I went to buy some water, the guy at the counter refused outright.  Another lady had been there since 11 am (her flight earlier that day was delayed) and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher. The guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude. My partner tweeted about this to BA and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone's pics at the same time. We finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too. There was not one person from British Airways this whole time till 1am in the morning.  As if this wasn't enough, when boarding started and we were showing our tickets, we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us. We were the tenth/twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us. There was no sign or announcement separating the two queues. Instead of politely mentioning that, this member of BA staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line. By then the so-called priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone. When I mentioned this, she told me that I was cutting the queue and wasting her time. We just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did. I am definitely never going to choose BA again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Venice,Gatwick

W Mierden,Jul-17,Naples to Gatwick,2.0,am soon likely to hate it,"Verified Review   Naples to Gatwick. I used to admire and love BA. I now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. I think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying Club Europe. My wife and I have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some Avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately not with blessings. We had, once again (!) been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife’s preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other – but why does BA have to keep doing this? The trip as such started well enough in the new BA South Terminal Lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks, food and magazines. When time came for boarding and, amongst others, Club Europe passengers were invited to board first, there was no check made at all, which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. Once boarded, we were – unlike the other Club Europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished). When I opened my meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it. We took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess, who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. The meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. And whilst I do not object to being served wine from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has to ask for a refill, something not everybody likes to do. This practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost-cutting exercise. On previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for Club Europe passengers are available in airports like Corfu, Rhodes, Heraklion, even Seville (contrary to BA’s website at the time – we were told at all these airports ‘ BA no longer pays for its passengers to have access’) so, this time, my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in Naples. She was told No; but at least, we knew beforehand – or so we thought, but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening, we were joined by some rather merry Club Europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge (though not exclusively for BA use) that they had been able to access and enjoy! Why could the check-in staff not have told us? The waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some. However, when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards, passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood, were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side. Club Europe passengers were amongst the first to be called, so that did not look too bad. Know what? We showed our boarding pass, then had to stand (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened. In other words, we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Negative,Naples,Gatwick
B Daliana,Jun-17,London to Montreal,3.0,on a par with Ryanair,"Verified Review   London to Montreal. I have also flown their economy plus (Montreal to London), and business class  (London-Tokyo, London-Rome return). BA Economy is on a par with Ryanair. Business is okay. Economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food. Regardless of class of travel, the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition. The following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller. I started watching a movie on the flight from Montreal to London but the last 15 min of the movie were missing. It looked like the recording consisted of only the first 105 min (out of 121 min total) of the movie. In the next few days I tried to see the last part of the movie on other two BA flights (business and economy plus) and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing. In addition to this minor problem, all BA flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system: the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise (once again, the same problem applied to all flights).",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Montreal
S Garton,Jun-17,London to Hong Kong,2.0,recommend to avoid flying with BA,"Verified Review   London to Hong Kong in premium economy. I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. I will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA.",Business,Premium Economy,['May'],Negative,Positive,London,Hong Kong
John Wallace,Jul-17,Belfast to Munich via Heathrow,1.0,serious need of a makeover,"Verified Review   Belfast to Munich via Heathrow. Today (4th July) I found I needed to change a travel date from 7th July to 6th July.  I attempted to do this on BA's ""Manage My Booking"" for about 2 hours and, although I selected 4 different flight times, each time I thought my booking change was completed (at an extra cost of £156-199 + seat costs), I was told that my changed flights were fully booked, even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available (quite a few). So. I contacted BA's Customer Services by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who, after saying hello and providing his name, promptly lost me. So, another 20 minutes later, I spoke to another (very caring and helpful) BA agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost +£500 onto my £218 ticket! I could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less! I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help.

Interesting that BA have dropped the ""to fly to serve advert"" Boarding was the usual unorganised shambles. Selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads. No less than three couples came on with oversized bags. In one instance, it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads, coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers. When complaints were made to cabin crew, the response was ""they are entitled to bring hand luggage"" The trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time. Most of the choices were unavailable. Cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders, and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system..

Initially I was very impressed when I spied the M&S food and drink menu which does merit appreciation. However, on flight BA 2645 from Malta to Gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly gutted. I am a strict vegetarian so I was happy to see the selection of vegetarian fayre but unfortunately by the time the trolley got to me (a long time I might add) there was no veggie sandwiches, no veggie focaccia, not even mixed nuts (for heavens sake!). Of course there was plenty for the non-vegetarians. Not only that but the Couscous Salad has chicken on it but no veggie alternative. I was very disappointed and BA need to do better.

When we asked him what information was incorrect he would not proceed with our call. On the 6th day when we were back at the airport to fly out we were told that the bag was delivered to our temporary address the day before, what a mess! We were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they would call us, when we arrived at Heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because 'there is no such thing as a place to follow up missing luggage, if you make a claim you need to just wait for a phone call. I never heard from anyone. We are back home now in Australia and I have just called to follow up the bag to which I was advised that the claim has been closed. Now I need to wait for the claim to be reopened and wait another 72hrs to get an update. Not once have we received a call from anyone, our phone bill is over $800AUS due to the amount of calls we had to make.

When the meals came round, I was told that BA had not passed on my dietary requirements, and all they could offer me was a small salad (half a tomato and some lettuce). When I landed, I emailed British Airways to complain, and ask them to ensure I had a gluten free meal on my return. I received no reply, and again there was no food for me on the flight. After countless emails, I finally received a message telling me that even though British Airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements, I should have contacted American Airlines to request it. British Airways apparently pick and choose which information they send to the carrier airlines. I told them that they shouldn't ask for information that they don't intent to pass on, but was met with the same 'you should have requested it better' line.

Check in was quick and friendly. But once we got through security the trauma of BA began. A 2 hour delay on the screen. Why didn't they tell us at check-in? Yes, they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. Once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet. No welcome. The seats were hard and uncomfortable. Before taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door. The door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty. A strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying! When the food service came I was asleep but my said they ignored her. When we did arrive at Heathrow T5 we ended up at the C gates, so adding another 20 minutes or so. Based on this I will no longer pick BA as a preference. The brand once the favourite airline is no longer.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,Zurich,London Heathrow
Kevin Edgar,Jun-17,Corfu to London,5.0,BA please admit your mistake,"Verified Review   Flew British Airways from Corfu to London Heathrow. Food service a joke. I have never written a review on anything in my life, but how can an airline like British Airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes? Unbelievable if the company has become so badly managed, (how many quangos to come up with this decision?) that common sense is lost in corporate nonsense. Apart from that, flight great, but sorry BA please admit your mistake and put this right.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Positive,Corfu,London
Melanie Marsh,May-17,Heathrow to Santorini,1.0,such bad customer service,"Verified Review   Heathrow to Santorini. We were at the gate when BA cancelled our flight. We could not get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage. It took them 4 days to return it. BA will not reimburse us the cost of the flights at £1,200 or the cost of the hotel at £2,000. This is a total disgrace. How can they be allowed to do that? Book with another airline to ensure you actually arrive. Never experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money is outrageous.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,Heathrow,Santorini
C Barnham,Jun-17,London Heathrow to Dublin,7.0,such a miserly product,"Verified Review   I had an early morning flight from London Heathrow to Dublin to attend a memorial service in Ireland. The check-in process seems to have been automated and I am not impressed. I saw an elderly Chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in BA uniform walked away and ignored them. I intervened and assisted. The interior of the aircraft was spotless. However, there was no catering per se other than a to buy Marks and Spencer items. No cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassed. The cabin crew were lovely people and deserve better than to have the name of a once proud national carrier reduced to such a miserly product. Arrival was punctual.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London Heathrow,Dublin
T Donovan,Jun-17,Bangkok to Luxembourg via London,4.0,time to pull up its socks,"Verified Review   Bangkok to Luxembourg via London. Premium economy on British Airways is disappointing. The Bangkok to London route is served by B777 aircraft that look like they've seen better days. Boarding was chaotic on both outward and return flights. Seats are old and worn, not very wide, and with little recline. The IFE is poor in terms of choice, the screens are the smallest I've ever seen, and the sound quality is very bad. The food served is ok. Service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg, with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline. The short haul flights between London and Luxembourg (in economy) were good. It's time for British Airways to pull up its socks if it wants to compete with the leading Asian, Middle Eastern airlines, or even the better European ones.",Business,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Neutral,Bangkok,Luxembourg via London
C Armstrong,Jun-17,New York JFK to Copenhagen via Heathrow,1.0,inadequate for the money paid,"Verified Review   Flew New York JFK to Copenhagen via Heathrow. Have flown Premium Economy (PE) on Cathay, Singapore, Lufthansa and Air France. By far, British Airways is the worst! World Traveler Plus just means Plus $$$$$, everything else is downhill. Seats were cramped, recline only a few millimeters, food awful, sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was served. Amenities practically non-existent and wrapped in cellophane, tube of toothpaste (if only the cap would open) could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth, no covers for the headphones. Totally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word Premium Economy. Before I forget, the Boarding Service was confusing, calling colors Gold, Silver, Sapphire, etc. People just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice, screaming for order. Why not just call the way you sell - First, Biz, Premium, Economy. Trying too hard to be fancy.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Negative,Negative,New York JFK,Copenhagen via Heathrow
H Jackson,May-17,London to Hamburg,1.0,They should be ashamed of themselves,"Verified Review   Flew London to Hamburg. I cannot believe that an airline like British Airways have to compete with the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet and stopped complimentary cabin services - no drinks, no snacks. They should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines.  I am now cofused why I should ever fly British Airways vs Low Cost Airlines. I was recently also flying on Club World. My luggage was tagged priority. But waited on arrival for over 30mins - non priority bags came out mixed with priority - British Airways policies and operations are clearly confused and it's losing its edge as a world reknowned airline.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London,Hamburg
H Jackson,Jun-17,Singapore to London,2.0,I am very disappointed,"Verified Review   Singapore to London. I have started to take British Airways as it's a corporate requirement. The Business Class (Club World) is more like Premium Economy. The seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window - you are basically trapped inside and you'd have to disturb the other passenger to get out. Furthermore, the ""bed"" does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift ""fold down stool"" - if you apply too much pressure on that stool, it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch - it's just flimsy! The food is very low quality and tatstes bland - I have already tried the regular meal and special meals - don't bother. The service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers. Overall, I am very disappointed.",Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Singapore,London

If you get through to their India call center you might as welll hang up the phone, as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the third party, will inturpt you when you are trying to speak, just awful service.

B Foster,Jun-17,Dusseldorf to London City,1.0,BA is going in the wrong direction,"Verified Review   I am a frequent flyer with British Airways, having held Silver membership for years. On this instance, I flew BA's short-haul business class. While you're essentially in the same cabin as everyone else, you should get a meal onboard (something I had counted on) and the seat next to you should be left empty. I fly this route around once every other week, but have been BA to long-haul destinations (Hong Kong, Beijing, NYC, D.C. and San Francisco) several times a year, my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights I have taken this year on the same and other routes. The aircraft came in late, which is a common occurrence with BA these days. Except for me, nobody in Business Class had an empty seat next to them. We were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered, although we 'might be' able to obtain food vouchers once we get to LCY. In short, the product was exactly the same as Economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket. This was complemented by slow and unfriendly check-in staff, an old aircraft, and a good hour I had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested BA customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through. On the whole, a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that BA is very much going in the wrong direction. They might be cheap, but can't and shouldn't compete with low-cost carriers or indeed Asian airlines that have lower overhead costs.",Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Dusseldorf,London City
A Marham,Jun-17,London Heathrow to Lisbon,1.0,from bad to worse,"Verified Review  British Airways seems to be going from bad to worse. On my London Heathrow to Lisbon flight, the card machine didn't accept American credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldn't pay for his drink. The length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren't offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing. The flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for BA. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline. They are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London Heathrow,Lisbon
J Rose,Jun-17,Edinburgh to Rome via Heathrow,2.0,are not a 4 star airline,"Verified Review   Edinburgh to Rome via Heathrow. I have been either BA Gold or Silver for many years , the last 2 years I was in Texas but ensured my return to UK that flights were always BA and the same for my family who visited. in July 2016 I returned to UK for business and had to stay until Jul 12th, I was 3 points off retaining get Gold if I had flown back on 11 July I would have retained Gold. I had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem, however I was duly downgraded to Silver. I then booked a holiday in Rome for my wife and myself and I was amazed that BA have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea ! If BA wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine. They have in the past left me stranded in Moscow for 5 days when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow, I have encountered rude staff on check in, long queues even for Executive members. They are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status, I will in future fly Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa or Internal UK Easyjet. They are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let get poor reviews. If BA wish to be a budget airline then start charging like one",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,['Jul'],Positive,Neutral,Edinburgh,Rome via Heathrow
V Graham,Apr-17,Tampa to Tirana via Gatwick,2.0,a total disappointment,"Verified Review  It was the fist time I traveled with British Airways and I believe it will be the last. I had to reschedule my flight from Tampa to Tirana via Gatwick from December 2016 to March 2017. First, I couldn't change it online as the 'manage your flight' option didn't work (they told me it happens some times), and I tried it a lot of times before contacting them, so I had to pay +25$ for changing it via phone (they took the money even though it wasn't my fault). I made more than 50 calls from November to a day before traveling to reissuing my e-ticket. After a long wait to get connected, they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the e-ticket and sent it to my e-mail, for nearly 6 months it never come until 1 day before the flight. Every time I called they said they didn't have my cvv which I re-confirmed every time. When asked when will I get the ticket, they said: after 10 days, which only came on 27th of March and I was to travel on 28th. Once they nearly set me to fly to Charlotte, NC, while confirming my data and cvv during one of the 50 calls I made. Besides this, the food was ridiculous, but never mind that, the anxiety, time consumed and the distress they caused can't be either bought or excused. How can a consolidated, serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible, unconcerned for the customer, not complying to the minimum standards? I expected soo much from them, it was a total disappointment!",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,Tampa,Tirana via Gatwick

However, when I went to the airport to check in the luggage BA insisted that I only had one bag allowance and I had to pay. I had no other choice so I paid.

Return flight cancelled after 4 hours on tarmac with the IT crash. Staff brilliant, including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he could.

S Cartey,May-17,Madeira to Gatwick,4.0,very disappointing experience ,Verified Review   Madeira to London. I was always of the belief that British Airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but I realise now that they are no better than budget airlines. In fact I have experienced far better service on EasyJet. We waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and I ordered Marks & Spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours. On top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. Of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took! They make it very clear that 'economy' class is just that but its shame the price doesn't match the standard of service. All in all a very disappointing experience and I will certainly think twice about choosing BA in future.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,Madeira,Gatwick

It didn't feel like a national carrier, felt more like budget airline with no snacks/drinks and fare class that doesn't include checked baggage. Flight was smooth enough, efficient but boarded 15mins late in Edinburgh. No service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Positive,Edinburgh,Gatwick
T Lameera,May-17,Rome to London,1.0,abandoned us at Rome airport,"Verified Review   Rome to London. Thursday May 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730. This caused missed connecting flight to Los Angeles. Very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants. No one took charge of our situation, information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. No one from BA was seen or heard from at hotel. Multiple calls by passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistance. Friday, May 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counter. After 1 hour in line I obtain a boarding pass on a flight to London with connection to Los Angeles, however the BA desk attendant informs me that the flight out of Rome is late due to technical issues and I will once again miss the flight out to LA. I'm appalled at the lack of educated, experienced BA assistance! BA abandoned us at Rome airport. In addition there web site is of no help.

P Tanner,May-17,London to Amsterdam,2.0,could not be less interested,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Amsterdam Schipol on BA434, landed at 14:30. Luggage did not arrive. Contacted ground agent - they could not be less interested. Was given some toiletries but no essentials such as cleanser or moisturiser. As it was a Sunday, all shops at Amsterdam were closed at 5pm so was not able to buy essentials like make up. Called the luggage call centre 3 times. The first time the agent put a note in the system to say that I needed my luggage urgently because of a customer meeting the next day. Then received message on phone that the luggage would be on a flight arriving at 20:20, subject to conditions. Called again to check if the luggage had left Heathrow. Agent could not tell and rudely told me to wait. Called again at 21:00 and finally got through. Agent said she would get someone to call me to let me know if it was possible for me to pick up the luggage at Schipol. No one called. Called the next day. All the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage would be delivered. Message to BA management: you can do better by having a truly on line tracing system and fulfilment system, by employing people who do care about your customers, and forget about telling your customers that 90% of people get their luggage back within 72 hours. For business travellers, that offers zero comfort. Take a leaf off Qatar Airways, one of your One World partners, they tell their customers if their luggage follows them during transit. And Qatar Airways ground service staff show that they do care.",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,London,Amsterdam

M Darssen,May-17,Mexico City to Copenhagen via London,6.0,I have given up on avios,Verified Review   Mexico City to Copenhagen via London. It appears inflight service has improved a bit in Club and the food is now edible and available. In flight entertainment reminds one of the VHS days. Number of films available is rather limited. Timing with food was great. Served quickly after take off and again late before arrival. Made time for a good rest. Configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats. Some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5.

As a result, we missed our connecting flight. For all the other connections that were missed, they had arranged for alternatives and announced them before the flight landed.

Now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight (boarding 6.15 for 6.50 flight) is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late. Holidays in Madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for 5.5hrs. I wrote to BA and got the big fob off. Add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane!

Paul Witten,Mar-17,London to Male,1.0,An absolute disgrace,"Verified Review   London to Male. I booked a flight for my wife to India but before paying for it I called the BA executive club to make sure that the fare was fully refundable. They told me that it was less an administration charge. I then had to cancel the booking and instead I booked a flight with BA to the Maldives.To my dismay I was not refunded what I expected for the fare to India. Instead they only refunded the taxes/insurance etc. for the cancelled booking. I called BA at the beginning of March to find out what had happened, They told me that they would get back to me within 30 days. Two months later I called them again and was told that the refund department would call me. This they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they would not pay me back. Either the executive club of BA are lying or they are incompetent. I was asked the time and date when I called BA but unfortunately I do not have it because I did not think it necessary to log the call. It is obvious to me that BA do not honour their commitments and I will no longer fly with them. I have been an executive member for 40 years and this is how BA treat their customers.

Business class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked off. Outbound from Dublin around lunchtime. I was hungry and all they had was some ham dish and nothing else. I was told I had to order a kosher meal if I did not eat ham. So I practically had nothing to eat. The stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snack. However I was looking forward to a decent meal after forking out for a business class flight. So I ordered a kosher meal for my return flight. I got the kosher meal but it was vile. Some sort of salmon that was tasteless. Very poor experience.

P Rennie,Apr-17,London to Toronto,2.0,on the edge of abandoning them,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Toronto. British Airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations. Recently as the Director I have been getting complaints about service, cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff, which I have listened to but have been too busy and really hadn't listened properly, exactly what BA seems to do based on my personal experience. This recent trip to Toronto summed everything up for me. Firstly, after paying around £1000 extra each for a Premium Economy seat for each of the three of us travelling, unlike competitors BA does not provide priority boarding, you line up with all the other economy passengers?. When on board you are met with smiling staff, some immaculately dressed, others who look as if they have had a bad night, so who manages quality and standards?. Premium economy offers a little more space than economy, however that is about it. Service levels in the cabin are minimum, food is unexceptional, and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price, and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and 'a biscuit' delivered with all the fanfare of a 'gold bar' being delivered, however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in Premium Economy was both palpable and vocal, and staff could not have cared less. Other companies such as Air Canada offer a superior experience for the same price. BA management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completely. Familiarity definitely breeds contempt, but BA really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products. The marketing image does not match the reality. BA Ground service and management at Toronto is appalling, staff sitting around, passengers bags missing, delayed, no one to help? staff being openly rude and dismissive.

S Dawson,Apr-17,London Heathrow to Phoenix,2.0,national carrier turned into the worst,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Phoenix. I have been flying with British Airways for years, although I haven't used them recently. I was surprised at the service or lack of service. Our national carrier has turned into the worst. The crew are nce and friendly, so no real complaints apart from on a 10.5 hour flight during the day, they were nowhere to be seen until about 1.5 hours before landing. The food was absolutely appalling. For dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian. I had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless.The chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purée, this was the only thing edible on the plate. A tiny beetroot salad. The obligatory hard as rock bread roll. For dessert, a small piece of chocolate brownie.Complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didn't realise they could ask for wine etc. A small container of water was on the tray.This meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. At which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box, a packet of crisp and popcorn (all carbohydrates) and a small container of water. I tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.Then tea/coffee was served.  I am not expecting a gourmet meal, but there was no thought given to the food provided on British Airways. There was no fruit, no salad, or proper vegetables. There were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. The flight entertainment did not exist. A couple of new films, the rest were old or unheard of. The music/radio (audio) was the same with no new music or unheard of artists. My daughter, booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the US. I have asked her not to book me on British Airways again. I would rather travel on Virgin or Delta indirect. This by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly I just couldn't wait to get off.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London Heathrow,Phoenix
Julie Torcasio,Apr-17,London Heathrow to Bangkok,7.0,pay extra to reserve the seats,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Bangkok. We had already flown BA10 from Bangkok to London a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route. Of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked J and K seats. Check in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn't even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn't it fixed prior to the flight?). For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet! Not good enough. Food and wine were OK and crew were good. Flat bed was good. Disembarking was slow. Same movies as BA10 four weeks earlier.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Negative,London Heathrow,Bangkok
S Dewhurst,Apr-17,London to Stockholm Arlanda,2.0,rapidly becoming a budget airline,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Stockholm Arlanda. BA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. I'm a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly BA, primarily to maintain it. Not any more. It's not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakes. The small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc. have gone too. And I'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6 weeks ahead. It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore. The last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedible. Just about to book with another airline on principle. I have to say I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave. If you're going to be a low cost airline, charge low cost prices.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Stockholm Arlanda
C Walton,Apr-17,Istanbul to London,1.0,little more than a budget airline,Verified Review   Istanbul to London. I am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one. It hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and British airways except the ticket price. My disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins. I haven't flown British Airways for years and I shocked by how much it had gone downhill. It is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers!

B Williams,Apr-17,Paris to London Heathrow,1.0,airline is in terminal decline,"Verified Review   Paris to London Heathrow. I am a BA Gold Guest list member with 75,000 tier points. I cannot believe what is happening to BA. The attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product. Cramped seats, chaotic boarding, every flight announced ""our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags"". In other words, they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage. Now you pay for food and even water. Two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. How can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. It is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service - a shame to be called British. This airline is in terminal decline and I need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline. Don't pay for BA shortfall, use cheap alternatives, its the same service.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Paris,London Heathrow
A Dawson,Apr-17,London to Dubai,4.0,really disappointed with BA,"Verified Review   Flew British Airways from London to Dubai. To start with, awful seats. I felt like I was being squashed by both passengers on either side of me. Need more room. Then it was rude staff, I was shocked. To top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and was working his way back. When I interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with me. When I moved my seat back after they had removed the food trays, a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me. I'm a female travelling alone and I felt frightened by that. Just shows how little space everyone has been given. I'm really disappointed with BA.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London,Dubai
B Renny,Apr-17,London to Moscow,1.0,employs tactics of EasyJet,"Verified Review   Flew with British Airways from London Heathrow to Moscow return over Easter 2017. The plane was old, seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpet. On the way to Moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. The food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and there were only two for a fully booked economy class). On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that I literally could not even cross my legs, as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. Seats were not reclining either. The food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight. Do not fly BA to Russia. It employs tactics of EasyJet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Moscow
Andreas Simonsen,Mar-17,Copenhagen to Mexico via London,8.0,service is polite,Verified Review   Copenhagen to Mexico City via London Heathrow. Upper deck window seat. British Airways uses a 2-4-2 configuration with every second seat backwards. To serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat. It also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you. This could be great or horrible. Food is nothing special but service is polite. Bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next day. I had to pick them up myself. Would fly again as usually have good fares to Mexico.,Business,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,Copenhagen,Mexico via London
T Masson,Apr-17,Prague to London,1.0,BA is now a budget airline,"Verified Review   Prague to London Heathrow. British Airways have lost the plot. BA is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare. Check-in is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed, such as gold members, bronze members, families, business class, silver members. They do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then it's a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane. Seating is fair, though leg room is tight. The flight left a little late but arrived almost on time, which was fine. There is no food, nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail's pace with a trolley. I can't believe BA now make passengers pay extra for food and drink. BA shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past. I wonder what has happened to BA for it to have fallen so far? This will be my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available as BA is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Prague,London
C Hosters,Apr-17,ORY to JFK via LHR,2.0,slightly above a budget airline,"Verified Review   Paris Orly to New York via London. Unlike some American carriers and some other European carriers, there is no beverage service on short haul flights. Tea costs 2.30 pounds.  Economy overseas is a joke too, they bring the premium drinks/service from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had. They replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options (cookies, snack-sized kit kats and snack-sized mars), you may only have one. I asked to have an extra snack, I was told no, only one. Onboard media is decent, but nothing to write home about.

When returning no buggy arrived at Heathrow - my two year old is now without a buggy and no one knows anything. I was told three different messages we have the buggy, we don't have the buggy?

M Dell,Apr-17,Baltimore to Nice via London,1.0,I have had it with BA,"Verified Review   Baltimore to Nice via London. My ordeal started when I could not check in online. I called BA and they said the flight is under airport control and I have to check in at the airport. Fair enough but I should have known something was wrong. When I get to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted to get a good seat) I was told that Premium Economy was overbooked, and that I was involuntarily being bumped to economy. Never mind that I bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago. The staff were not even nice about it. Quite beligerent. They offered me a Compensation card for $94. Where they got this amount, I don't know. I would have preferred the seat. Then they tell me I need to contact BA for a refund of the difference in price. Why should I need to contact them? They moved me, they know they moved me, shouldn't it be automatic? So I am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake. I did send an e-mail on their refund form and have yet to hear from them. It has been a week. I had a horrible flight. I have severe back pain (one reason I booked premium, for the extra room) which was made worse by my economy seat. My screen did not work for movies, although the flight attendants did try. It is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip. Fast forward, while in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declined.  So I tried to use it on Amazon and Nespresso online. Also declined. Really BA? I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not working. Nothing. I have flown BA in the past and have been happy with the. Not anymore.  I have had it with BA.

The flight from Heathrow back to JFK had many delays, although this was out of anyone's control, it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane (5 hours). At first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible, but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about. The other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new plane. I wish the discomfort of the plane, bad food, and time of delays were reduced dramatically.

C Fisher,Nov-16,London to New Delhi,1.0,Very very poor customer service,Verified Review   Very very poor customer service from British Airways. Myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of Oman. While upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to Oman. When we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in Oman to get our boarding passes. On arriving in Oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full. We were left there for 4 hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments. After pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to Bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination New Delhi. We were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day. To say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,London,New Delhi
D Stewart,Nov-16,London to Singapore,1.0,nothing redeeming about BA,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Singapore. Business class flight from Heathrow to Singapore. Flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why, and we were not kept informed. It seems BA is these days later in taking off. During the flight I felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class, and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset. The main meal we were served was absolutely awful. It was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just like gunge, and was not edible. I really don't know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. Also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed - which seemed totally unnecessary. As I was hungry between courses I went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor, and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason. I have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years. I have been a BA silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew. I always try and fly Qatar where possible when going to Asia now, as the service is better and often the price too. There is nothing redeeming about BA.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Singapore
L Johnson,Apr-17,London Heathrow to Rome,1.0,can no longer live on past reputation,"Verified Review  Having only flown easyJet / Ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, I was pleased to see a relatively low-cost BA flight for my round trip from London to Rome. In hindsight, I wish I'd booked a different airline and not booked BA based on its legacy reputation. To say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. I expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. Narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. Regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. Even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. Lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. I was also tantalised by the BA bragging of M&S supplied food. I am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. It certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. Sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. No sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. I asked what they did have. Their response 'Bottle of water or a Kit Kat'. After asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'They never give us enough food. It's mad. They give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. Needless to say that BA can no longer live on their past reputation. They had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. Sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. I'd say I'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, I won't bother. What a shame.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,London Heathrow,Rome

B Taylor,Mar-17,Malaga to Gatwick,1.0,BA has gone cattle,"Verified Review  British Airways has got it wrong on short European hauls. Malaga to Gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class, the food / drink trolley will block access to the toilet. Seated at the tail end of the plane, the food is very likely to run out. On my flight the promised M&S was limited to ""snacks"" (£1.80 water, £1.20 KitKat). Credit/debit cards only, no cash, and this meant a very painfully slow ""service"". One working toilet for the economy class, the other one was out of order - but the business class toilet at the front was out of reach for the ""cattle class"", leaving me wait for over an hour. I was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about 80 minute, a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle, then of air turbulence. The cabin crew seems desperate to get the 1 trolley (hence the slowness) to the end of the cabin. People needing the toilet was obviously not a priority. They certainly did not let me pass during the 40 minutes or more without air turbulence. BA has gone ""cattle"".",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Malaga,Gatwick

On our 13 hour night flight I discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline. Spent 13 hours sitting upright while everyone around me was in a reclined position. Complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when I returned home to Amsterdam. This is exactly what I did. BA replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a GBP25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more. What an insult! Its unfair that I paid the same price as the rest of the passengers, that's unfair. They do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter. Very arrogant and not customer friendly at all. I feel cheated. British Airways obviously does not value their customers. A GBP25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day, but for a long overnight flight, its an insult.

Paul Burgess,Mar-17,Frankfurt to Hong Kong via London,2.0,well below every major competitor,"Verified Review   Frankfurt to Hong Kong via London. This will definitely be my last time with British Airways, I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut to. Staff onboard were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to HKG and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline. If you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated.",Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Positive,Frankfurt,Hong Kong via London
S Lepinski,Mar-17,London to Istanbul,1.0,my last time to book with them,"Verified Review   This will be my last time to book a trip with them. I booked a return trip for April 2017 from London to Istanbul a few months in advance, they ended up cancelling my 11:00 flight and moving me to the 07:00 flight which would not work for me. After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. On calling yesterday they told me that I had accepted the changes as it was months ago I told her that the other agent suggested that I wait and decide later. This was followed by the fact that I had purchased a cabin bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. Although this was not my fault. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer. I called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty. I have rebooked with Turkish Airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute, they include food, checked bag, drinks and seat selection and sometimes a Boeing 777 on this route.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Istanbul

Maz Syed,Mar-17,London to Dublin,3.0,not be flying BA again,"Verified Review   London to Dublin. I had not flown with British Airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to Dublin from London Heathrow Terminal 5. It all started again, I had downloaded the BA app from the Apple App store and I tried to check in the night before using the app but I was getting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time, I thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when I was sat in the Taxi to the airport. On the app I noticed that the flight had been delayed by approx. 1 hour and some minutes (considering it is a local flight and I was flying with hand luggage only) I decided to stop so that I can get some food as having flown multiple times in the past 3 months (at least once and sometimes twice every week) I was under the impression that as long as I am at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues (after all that's the whole point of flight updates?). When I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to Zone E to get a Boarding pass printed by the counter staff, after waiting 20 minutes in the queue (bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off) I was told that the flight has been closed and as I was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and I ca not fly on that flight so I will have to take the next one (from 8am flight I was moved to 11am flight). After discussing with the check in manager I was told that there is nothing he can do as he doesn't make the rules. Needless to say that I had to book onto the next flight despite being through security and in the waiting area over an hour before the actual flight took off. If this is how the BA customers are to be treated, i.e. they have to be there on time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then I for one will most definitely not be flying BA again, the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it seems in this case (they are not putting any value on my / other customers time i.e. we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late ).",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,London,Dublin

The only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me. The seat I then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back (old food stains) and on the belt. No drink served with meal (except water). When I eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. I had a white wine. When I asked for a second (yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight I was told they had run out of wine also). I had to have orange juice. Awful and rude staff (with exception of one).

Simon Oakley,Feb-17,San Jose to Gatwick,5.0,experience was a bit shoddy,"❎ Unverified   Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way.

E Roper,Mar-17,Hyderabad to London,3.0,lack of care extremely disappointing,"Verified Review   Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business.

She had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip. As for the food menu? The food is so expensive and it's easy to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices. An airline should not represent a country when it's based on profit above it's people.

I don't know why I chose to fly BA - a sense of nostalgia I think. Going to India this time, I decided to go east, via LHR and BA seemed a good idea. I will not do so again.

THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline"" - ""But BA did all the booking!"". Blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually phoned and got the PNR and checked myself in with a boarding pass. Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. When I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. The fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. Essentially despite BA being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. The flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. On the way back - forget it. Firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! When I asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the plane. I was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. The breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever had. The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. I'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I'm not fat. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta and American Airlines internationals are much better. Generally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. I'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. Its not because they are so much cheaper than others. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. What happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago? (the last time I flew BA). Overall - it's sad.",Business,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Mumbai,Seattle via London

H Rainer,Feb-17,London Heathrow to Bangkok,1.0,this is by far the worst,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Bangkok. As you walk into Heathrow T5 you have the feeling of a world class airline - and that's where it stopped! 20 minutes late for boarding then only after they had got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up - it took them 1 hour to fix the plane didn't tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags! I gave up my seat 38D for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so I got 40D - big mistake! Seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down. Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above - when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a co-worker that's the last of her problems. It was the coldest plane I have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets I was that cold I took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet. Toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight. They had to manually reset everyone's screens, they were very old, the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired. Not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag. The interior on the seating was old and lumpy I'm sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw! They don't even have USB's to charge your phone!  So they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any USB charge points around the plane.

Having flown BA on this route from Orlando to London Heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill. When I went to the back of the plane to ask for a snack I was told I had to buy them. Having paid over £1000 for my tickets I replied I'm not doing that I've paid enough for this flight already. To which the cabin manager replied 'well thats just the way the industry is going, people want value for money and this is how you get it, all the airlines are doing it, if you don't like it tough'. I have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life! As well as this the seats were old and the screens didn't work. Other airlines namely Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, even American, in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money, you even still get snacks on long haul flights!

R Lake,Dec-16,Vienna to Los Angeles via London,1.0,they couldn't do anything for me,"Verified Review   Vienna to Los Angeles via London. On 12/31/16 at 5pm the night before my flight, I received an email saying that my first leg to London had been cancelled and I needed to call to reschedule. On the phone, the rep told me that he had a flight out later in the day I could take on the 31st. I said great book that. He did and I received the conformation and noticed that the flight was scheduled for 1/31/17. I told him and he said ""Oh yes that was an error on our part"". However, to book this he gave up my other seat. I told him this was his mistake and he needed to fix it. He said the only thing he could do was give me a partial refund which would be useless as it was $2k to buy a new ticket or I could fly out on 1/4/17. I asked if British Airways would comp my hotel for their mistake. He said no and I asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for 4 more nights. He had no answer. He refused to book me on any other airline. I asked for a manager he said there were none available. I fought with BA from 5pm until 1am (no exaggeration, I have screeenshots of the phone calls). I decided to get up at 6am, go to the airport, and talk with a BA rep - only to find out they have no BA reps but a rep representing a BA rep. She told me at first she could do nothing either and I told her I did not care where in the US she got me just get me to the US. She managed to get me a flight to Philadelphia the next day. She comp'd my hotel for the night and all meals. As a business who has inconvenienced me should. However, she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and I had to individually check in to each one. The check-in associate also failed to do so. Therefore, when the stewardess for AirBerlin was 30 minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit, I had to run to the next gate only to find out I wasn't checked in so they gave my seat away. I begged and pleaded (and cried) and they somehow by the grace of a higher being found a seat. Upon arrival into the US I was so grateful, until I found out my bag was left in Dusseldorf. It took another 2 weeks to get it back. At the end of it, BA left me in a $400 deficit (had to get home to CA from Philly) . I contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear back and all they had to say was that they couldn't do anything for me. Next time I will spend however much more it costs to fly with an airline who has some form of management overseeing their employees and I know will not screw me over.

If ever I had a choice between them and another airline I chose British Airways, but no more. The new food and drink service is appalling. The crew on our flight never made it to the last 8 or so rows, so my children (sat at the back) went thirsty. This was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere - clearly that is not BA's fault, but it is their fault that I couldn't then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane.

Gillian Seaton,Oct-16,London to Rio de Janeiro,3.0,quality dropped dramatically,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro. 45 minute delay on the tarmac. Air conditioning wasn't working during delay - would only work once engines were on. The cabin was therefore unbearably hot. The foam in my seat 30B had deteriorated to the point I could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone. I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. This is a 12 hour flight and I don't think this is acceptable. I was very uncomfortable during this flight. In flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blipping. In flight snacks now have to be paid for. Considering the price of flights, I think this is very poor. British Airways is not a budget airline. In fact airlines currently rated lower than BA in the Top 100 airlines (eg Virgin Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines) still provide complimentary on board snacks. There were two in flight meals on this flight - on both occasions I was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out. Once, I could forgive - but twice? When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'. How rude! I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff. The quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. No crackers or cheese, no fruit. What is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake (both of which I intensely dislike). This is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting. I'd had no choice in your menu, and what was served up was unpalatable. I have to take medication that needs to be taken with food - I had no choice but to purchase food on board. An additional charge on an already expensive flight is a 'hard pill to swallow'.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Rio de Janeiro

Paid £250 to pre-book my seats as my wife is a nervous flyer and likes a window seat. Before we even left BA changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying us. Luckily I spotted this on the booking portal and changed them back to a window seat. To cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo! On complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund. I was told 'they are always doing this'. On returning back to the UK on Christmas Eve I contacted Customer Service and was told I would receive a refund (I took the Customer Services Operators name and ID number) - no refund. I completed the on-line complaints form - I received an acknowledgment - nothing happened. I wrote to the Chief Executive, no acknowledgement, nothing. I wrote to the Refunds Department, no acknowledgement, nothing. I chased Customer Services again and was told the Refund Department is so busy. I will never fly with BA again. To quote British Airway Customers Service response ""I completely understand why you’re unhappy you didn’t get your preferred seats. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you. I hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon."" My response was that 'I don't think so'.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,New York

This is now some weeks on since they introduced their buy onboard snack options, but cabin staff acted like it was their first day and that they had no training. Okay, it might not be easy for them, but they all appeared very bad tempered with customer questions about the new Ryanair style service, and a lot of tutting as they served those who decided to buy something. I am sick and tired of the CEO of BA telling us everywhere this is what their customers asked for. Be honest and accept that this is a ploy to enhance your personal bonus at the end of year and keep shareholders happy.

E Sapiwu,Dec-16,London to Abuja,1.0,vowed to never fly with BA,"Verified Review   I was returning home for my wedding on December 27, 2016, connecting to British Airways from London Heathrow to Abuja. The seat I had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet. I never got an explanation for this action. However, I wasn't very fussy about this as I was very excited to be getting married. Also, the flight was dirty, the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place. Our flight arrived at the Abuja airport and I was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within Nigeria. I went to claim my luggage at the carousel, I waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and I couldn't find my luggage which had my wedding items in it, including my wedding dress. As you can imagine I was devastated, I had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue. I spent the night at Abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one BA flight arrives from Heathrow to Abuja each day. My luggage never arrived the next day. Myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items. The BA staff at the airport weren't helpful at all, they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was. My luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape. Up till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven't refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them.

Susan Constantinou,Jan-17,Larnaca to London Heathrow,4.0,letting themselves down badly,"Verified Review   We flew from Heathrow to Larnaca return. The aeroplane was old and tired, uncomfortable seats, overhead TV screens which can hardly be viewed from the seats we had chose. My headphones did not work in the seat either. But apart from it being a somewhat OK ish journey the offering of food and drink was shocking. We can only choose food and drink from a Marks and Spencer's booklet, believe me the food is not up to M&S quality, they should never have put their good name behind this BA endeavour to cut costs. Whilst I accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems, the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit card which had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shameful. What on earth are BA thinking about? British Airways are seriously letting themselves down badly. We felt like low budget airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets. Indeed if we had flown with Easyjet or Ryanair we would have saved ourselves hundreds of pounds.

Niina Ursin,Dec-16,CDG to LHR,3.0,will never fly with BA again,"Verified Review   Never again! Booked a round trip from to London from Paris return with British Airways in business as had a separate ticket from Paris to Johannesburg (with AF in business class) and Cape Town to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. The plan was to get refreshed in the lounge, rest for few hours and get on the flight. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was ""well, get a bus"". No indication of where. The woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. Tried to get some more information to which the reply was ""go online"". She gave me a paper which I thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. Thought ok, at least something. The next shock, when I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy! As I was very tired and just wanted to get home, agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. Was told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complain. Gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating ""go online, I don't care about BA"". When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. Complained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensation. Generic reply after 5 minutes was, no compensation.

Y Li,Oct-16,PVG to ZRH via LHR,1.0,incompetence and insincerity,"Verified Review   Shanghai to Zurich via London return, and British Airways is absolutely appalling. I have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline. I booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and I to go from Shanghai to Zurich via London. On the way there, the flight to Zurich was cancelled due to French strike, not BA's fault so that part is clear. However, they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled, furthermore, they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours (after a 12 hours flight) to go through customs (thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers), find a hotel, arrange our own transport there and back. So the first leg already left a terrible impression. Then, on the way back to Shanghai, they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I to economy for a 12 hour flight. I booked premium economy for a reason, my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? No. Told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat, then at boarding, told us sorry it's either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat. Because I had work the next day, we had no option but to fly and BA ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap. Three months down the track, I have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbers/emails to write to, only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole.

Rodrigo Steed,Jan-17,JFK to LHR,6.0,felt I was flying with a low cost airline,"Verified Review   Well, I've checked in online hoping that it would actually speed things up when at the airport. Silly me. The queue was ridiculous for bag drop and I had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag! The queue for assisted check in was far quicker – I think that things got inverted now. Maybe quicker to check in at the airport? So I was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight. British Airways were completely under staffed and disorganised. There were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues. Total fail. I felt I was flying with a low cost airline. I kept checking the flight details for any planned delays - it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow, etc, but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 10.22 instead of the planned departure at 10.00. Well, that was the case until 5 minutes before 10.22! Finally we got 'updated'. I doubt that this was only known at that time. Why wasn't there an update before? Anyway, new departure time scheduled for 11.59. We only started boarding at 11.00. Then, inside the cabin, we waited for another hour until taking off. At no point did BA offer vouchers. We only ate inside the cabin after 2am. The flight was terrible but that's another story. I see no point at flying with BA (for a few years now). Staff are old and 'entitled'. When you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft, you are presented with filthy dirty seats. Food getting worse and worse, and in board entertaining – almost non-existent.

Gail Ballantyne,Jul-16,London to Frankfurt,2.0,will never fly them again,"Verified Review   I paid almost £300 to fly from London to Frankfurt. The flight took off and then was re-routed back to London because of weather and German air space closing. The communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room, only to learn they still hadn't rebooked my flight. While waiting in line, I tried multiple times to call their customer service number, and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell phone costs. The rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land, and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning. Which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare London heatwave. I landed almost a day later than planned, but my bag didn't make it from London for another four days. British Airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses they'd reimburse, yet then denied portions of my claim. The delays, lost baggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holiday.

However a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight, no explanation as to the reason. Fortunately I was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices. This was a 4 hour flight by the way. I had no idea that BA are now charging for food and drink even for water (they kept that one quiet). I rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat (they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring). How long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as Ryanair. Will they be selling lottery tickets next? Pay-as-you go toilet? British Airways still refer to themselves as ""the worlds favourite airline"". Based on who`s opinion exactly? See no point in using BA now. They usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route. They have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers. I fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid BA. With this latest money grabbing scam I will change my scheduling to avoid them. There are plenty other quality carriers who like BA are struggling to maintain profits.

Alice Boyd,Dec-16,LHR to DFW,3.0,we don't deserve the shoddy treatment,"Verified Review   
This latest British Airways trip from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth just confirms how standards are slipping. Background: family living in USA = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying Business for eastbound transatlantic leg. To date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with British Airways. Service has been almost consistently good or very good. We may not be Gold or Silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW leg was booked by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. Subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. The Executive Club customer service link just sends you round in circles! A formal emailed complaint through ""Contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've had problems"" - but no solution offered. Teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight LHR-DFW departing 1030. Refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. When asked, steward responded ""well, that's cutbacks for you"". Pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. No problem. Juice and water were available during the afternoon. No snacks available for children for 5 hours! ""Cutbacks"". Luckily I had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in USA). At 1830 cabin service (tea) started. When I asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""Why didn't you order one?"" ""I did!"" ""She didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""Yes, she did!"" ""Oh well, I'll check when I've finished serving the main cabin"" Really? We were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? Clearly yes it would. And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. No hint of an apology. Customer service?

J Kovasko,Jan-17,LHR to PRG,1.0,joined budget airline bunch,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Prague. I've been commuting to and from work for last six and half years. The only airline that takes me to London Heathrow is British Airways. Sometimes I fly there and back up to two times a week. I do not eat on flights, so I thought BA's decision to charge for food was not gonna upset me too much. However they've managed. I always bring my own good quality tea and a cup and ask crew for some hot water. Drink my tea and go to sleep. To my surprise I am not allowed to get hot water anymore! In fact I am not allowed to get any water on BA shorthaul flight unless I pay (even if I bring my own cup and tea) or unless it's medical emergency, then I could get cup of cold water for free. So not only they didn't lower the fare, but they also sucessfully joined budget airline bunch by charging even for water! To my great regret they are the only airline that takes me to Heathrow so I can't take my custom anywhere else unless I change job. But if I am to fly on holiday, British Airways will not be my chosen carrier ever again.",Business,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,LHR,PRG

We were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to Barbados. After take off we were served complimentary drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been abolished but wasn't unduly concerned. Dinner was served shortly afterwards which I was good although cheese and biscuits had been cut too. The flight time was almost 9 hours so we were feeling hungry 4 hours after the main meal. I was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat, a small bag of crisps or 2 small biscuits! The cabin staff told me it was the new policy, and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles!  There were not even any sandwiches for sale! Fortunately for us soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and I noticed she was carrying a sandwich, I asked her where she had got it, and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it!  No one advised us that there was only one meal in 9 hours, if so we would have bought a sandwich with us. I looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut backs. So if your planning on travelling with British Airways economy to Barbados make sure you pack a sandwich. Return flight we was prepared as only a biscuit was given out.

They have sent my bags to Heathrow even though I'm going to LAX. I expect them to know, check, or at least ask where I'm going. To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight.

It was my first flight with BA, and probably my last one. BA is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cutting. In business class each row has 8 seats, never seen that in a recent business class, and you can forget any privacy. The seat is comfortable in sitting position but becomes not comfy in bed position as you have to open a second tiny seat to put your feet. Not convenient.

No headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and  I had a fault on the lights above the seats. This airline is going down fast and I will be happy to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputation of BA. I will try not to fly them again.

I was disappointed with the lack of food provided by British Airways on this flight. Gone are the days where you get a pack of peanuts with the drink early on in the flight. The Muslim meal was really not nice at all, and I should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice! I was so tired, however outbound and inbound I found the seats to be decent. Inflight entertainment was quite good too (did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phones however).

However, it took an hour at least to serve the meal. The twins continued crying as they didn't eat the main meal. I went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored! Eventually a Steward came to collect a trolley for Business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help. I explained the situation to him and he gave me a packet which contained two biscuits.

He gave passengers the choice not to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them. He explained we need to be onboard, ready to fly at a moment's notice, but we could be waiting 4 to 5 hours.

Also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with Avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines. How sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice. Why do you think people chose British Airways? As they are more expensive?

M Dammud,Dec-16,DXB to YYZ via LHR,1.0,give this rotten airline 0/10,"Verified Review   Dubai to Toronto via London, and I tried to check-in online. However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA’s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a “random” security hold by airport authorities. When I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing ETA for travel to Canada. When I informed her that could not be the case as I was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA’s control. The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. As I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future leadership. In any case, this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Such is the competency and class of this “manager” but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage – adding salt to wound. I flew to London from Dubai several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them. Finally, I called the UK ""Customer Relations"" center from Toronto, but I gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. They are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too. I wish I could give this rotten airline 0/10, but the minimum is 1/10 and I am happy with that.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Negative,DXB,YYZ via LHR

The first flight, BA informed me at the airport I no longer had a ticket, as they had oversold the flight. They then explained I would have a free hotel stay, as if I had won a prize. I avoided them for months after that one. Then I slipped back into a bad habit and booked them again for a work trip to Ukraine. On the return trip, they asked me if I would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day, as my outbound plane was delayed. I said no thank you, as my BA connecting flight was delayed by the same amount. I arrived 90 minutes prior to take off for the connection (all in the same terminal), suddenly the boarding pass on my phone disappeared and was replaced with a ticket for 9.45am the following day. They ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought I would not make it. Here I am is my reply. 'Sorry sir, the plane is now closed'. 'So you sold my ticket on'. 'No sir, but the plane is closed'. 'It cant be closed, there is plenty of time'. 'Yes, but there are no seats'. I debated the point. 'I wouldn't debate the point sir, a lot of people have been pushed off flights today, and hotels in London are being booked out, if I were you I would jump on the internet and find accommodation'. Because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in London (BA cover rooms up to £200, fine, though if you have kids they give you a mere £12.50 to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner for each child - in London, good luck). Get a hotel, arrive back at the airport the next day, wait in line for 2 hours (luckily I arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight), get to the check in desk. Guess what, I am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away. Again, of course, its my problem. 'Go to the special management desk sir'. At that desk they tell me it could be today I get home, it could be tomorrow, but its hard to say, given the Xmas period. But all in super surly tone, and it was clear this was all my fault. 'You can try another airline sir but they are all booked out' (at this stage I began checking car rentals and ferry times). Absolutely disgusting attitude. Every other airline I have dealt with, in these type of situations, booked me a hotel, and had a bus waiting or a taxi, with a return boarding pass for the next day. Its a shame, as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch. A team that is utterly let down by corporate, with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies. So I would love to fly BA for the crew and pilots, but given their utterly terrible customer care, its just not worth it.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,KBP,BFS via LHR

I had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so I could wait having a refreshment. But this 10th December was just not acceptable, and my last trip with them. I had three flights lined up. San Diego to Seville, all three operated with British Airways. Their first plane was late by two hours. By the time we arrived into London I had lost my connecting flight.

I arrived at Manchester terminal 3 at 08:00 and checked in to my booked flights. My outbound transfer flight BA1389 was delayed by over 3 hours (schedule 09:55, actual 13:10). At Manchester airport, the BA service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers. After a 2 hour queue, they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service desk. I boarded the late flight to Manchester, hoping that BA Heathrow could help me with the connecting Virgin Atlantic flight when I arrived at Heathrow. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to Shanghai. My flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 (Schedule 11:05, actual 14:06). Upon arrival at Heathrow (14:30), I proceeded to go to the BA service desk at Terminal 5 to find the next flights to Shanghai. After a 1 hour wait in the queue, the BA service personnel were not only unhelpful, but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. They refused to help me book another flight to Shanghai, they refused to book me on a flight back to Manchester, they refused to help me retrieve my luggage, they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the £1814.60 air fare. I explained that I was now stranded in Heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage, but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further. When I pleaded with the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers. At no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that I was in.  I was left outside Terminal 5 with no transport, no accommodation and no luggage. Eventually, after asking several helpful members of airport staff, I retrieved my luggage from Terminal 2.

There was a roll but no butter, instead a tiny pot of 'spread' that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered. For 'breakfast' we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick. No juice etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable. The flight attendant suggested that I should recline my seat as well and couldn't understand when I refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite. Eventually the passenger in front of me must have got the message because she put her seat back off her own bat.

S Mallen,Dec-16,NBO to LHR,2.0,like some cut-rate budget airline,"Verified Review   I have been a loyal BA frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well change. On my recent long haul flight to Nairobi from London, I was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free - like some cut-rate budget short haul airline, you have to pay. However, unlike a budget airline, BA fares remain higher than most. I returned from Nairobi in premium economy - yet instead of getting something for the substantial extra fare I paid to be in premium, breakfast consisted of 1 muffin - literally 1 muffin only - no juice, no fruit, no nothing. It is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have, as I have always done, accepted the higher fares for better service. Even the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regime. It is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free. Note that BA never cut fares when the price of oil halved, making the current cutbacks about pure avarice. Disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula. And I wouldn't blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated. The final insult was the response I got when I tweeted my above complaints. I was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast - while paying the same fare.

The small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort. He couldn't even watch the in-flight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. As a shorter limbed person at 5'4"", I was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight. Placed in the middle, I barely had any where to put myself, seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build. My headphone socket was crackling and the film I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time) wasn't working, it was just a black screen with audio. After travelling long haul last year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on BA. Within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers. On BA we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink.

As a member of their Executive Club and someone who has flown with British Airways 3 times this year I now regard them as the airline of last resort. The service on BA is beneath contempt. Ryanair used to be the source of most complaints when flying, but in my experience Ryanair service and punctuality beats BA with their reliance on a long lost reputation. Every BA flight I have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption. From disruption in the cabin the like of which I have never witnessed on any airline other than British Airways, to delays on nearly all BA flights I have taken in 2016, rude, surly staff that act like BA was still a 1970's state enterprise. Now when I search a flight and BA appears I shudder. It is even worth leaving the UK so you get a different national airline. There were even problems with the booking process. What makes matters worse is that British Airways accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matters right.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,AMS,LHR

I have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin baggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle. Another small camera pouch they consider as a separate bag. I was forced to give my cabin bag to my father in law and left with a normal handy bag with all stuff in it. Coming to the aircraft, food and staff - equally poor. Food was horrific, seats were torn, headphone socket not working, food tray was broken (I was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs) , tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches.

Doesn't matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff. Apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane. However, on boarding the plane there were people that had 3, or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours. These items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in. Other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken. When we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on. When contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight. Absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline.

Anne Drew,Sep-16,LGW to ANU,1.0,cutting too many corners,"Verified Review   London Gatwick to Antigua. Having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in Antigua at a cost of £350 to British Airways World Traveller Plus, and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade, better choice of meals and beverages. What we received was a polarisation of this - we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. Having flown long haul with BA on numerous occasions in the past I am completely shocked at the service we received - it was more like a budget airline - we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off, this was quickly followed with a drink service (one drink per passenger), we then received our meal service. I asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice - about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee. This is not the type of service I expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded World Traveller Plus cabin. After several hours when no other drinks service was offered I went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé, to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine - which neither one of us drink. As the flight wasn't full I cant believe there would be a problem you just don't expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight? 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours - certainly not what I would expect from an airline such as BA. Our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasn't full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us. The service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie. same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant. I was looking to book a long haul holiday to the Maldives next year with BA but after this flight and the appalling customer service I received when I complained about the service on the flight when I was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger TV screen and bigger seat - which I certainly don't think that justifies £350 upgrade fee. If you are thinking of upgrading I would think twice about what you are paying for. BA have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday I am not alone in making this decision and therefore I have booked my holiday next year with Virgin Atlantic. BA can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route. If that is the case, they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Negative,Negative,LGW,ANU

H Mason,Nov-16,BCN to LHR,3.0,it was beyond ridiculous,"Verified Review   Barcelona to London. Has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to Spain? According to a British Airways gate agent at Barcelona Airport, I supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave Spain. I drove across the border from the States to meet a friend in Canada and flew out from Vancouver on the same day to London for a week, and then from London to Spain for two weeks. All along the way of going through customs of Canada, UK, and Spain, I was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when I was leaving Spain. All of a sudden, this gate agent asked me “where are you going?  Where do you live?  Are you traveling alone?” I thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me “you have to wait here, I need to talk to someone.” There were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why I cannot get on the airplane.  I am a permanent resident of US; however, I am a citizen of the country participates in Visa Waver Program, which means I don’t need visa to enter Spain and definitely not when I leave. So, what’s wrong!? My name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my US Permanent Resident Card does not match with my passport. Of course, I just got married so that I have different last name from my passport, but even that, what kind of right does she have to ask me for my US Permanent Resident Card and stop me at the gate like that?! So, when she asked me if I have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name, I jokingly answered “marriage certificate??” Next thing I know was I cannot get on the airplane because I didn’t have marriage certificate with me, and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone, she said to me ""you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you.""

The crew looked miserable as if they didn't enjoy their job. Asking for anything was like a chore for them. One of the crew looked so untidy, her hair was all over the place. I asked to buy a bottle of perfume, when they came round with the duty free. The steward said he would come down with it soon. I waited and waited, then approached him an hour before landing. He apologised and said he forgot, that he will bring it down now. Again I waited, and just before we were ready to land I asked again, he returned with a bashed in box of perfume and said sorry but this is the last one.

Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency.

Bram Vanderelst,Nov-16,LGW to SVQ via MAD,2.0,they started dropping the ball,"London to Seville via Madrid. If you want budget airline service but decent airline prices, look no further than British Airways. I used to fly a lot with BA for both business and pleasure. But lately they really started dropping the ball. In 2016 I had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours. But that is not the worst. Recently I booked a flight to Seville from London. After a few weeks this flight got cancelled. It took me 3 different operators to find a solution via Madrid on the same day. ('No I don't want to fly the next day!). But guess what, 1 month later my outbound to Madrid got cancelled as well. Again it took some time to find an alternative. Ultimately I had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 2.5 hours. Also I need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in Seville. After complaining to BA about this process, I expected to get some sort of compensation, after all I'm an esteemed Silver member (their words). But none of that. A few phone calls later I am stuck with an automated e-mail service replying to me that no compensation is possible. I didn't ask for any money or anything. All I asked for is to waive the re-booking fee if I ever have to change a flight. This seemed only fair after BA cancels flights willy-nilly and doesn't take the customer into account. If this is the service extended to a Silver member, then I really don't want to know what they do to customers not part of their frequent flyer scheme.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,LGW,SVQ via MAD

Check in at Bari was resonable smooth, unlike on my outward flight, but the boarding process was the now expected chaos. The decision to issue hand luggage only tickets is a poor one. Unlike other airlines, no attempt appears to be made to regulate the size or weight of bags carried on board. On this flight, I witnessed several arguments over locker space.

Does BA ground staff care about it? The ""computer says no"" attitude prevails together with the usual BA familiarity and ""sorry"" that means nothing. Try to be more professional and show some respect. Now the customer service is non existent and no one cares about anything.

P Latore,Aug-16,MAD to PER via SIN,4.0,positioning as a budget airline,"Verified Review   Madrid to Perth via Singapore. So disappointed with BA. Really useless airline. Flight delayed on arrival to London 3 hours and no reason given. Missed connecting flight to Perth from Singapore. Was given Pay-in lounge access and this was better than nothing but I wonder why they couldn't have just given me access to their lounge. I decided to give them a chance since avoiding BA/QF flying between Australia and Europe but I never will again. Pay to reserve seats? Pay to request meal? I guess BA is positioning itself as a budget airline, but its price doesn't reflect that yet. It's a shame as I enjoy the transit through Singapore rather than the gulf states. Meal service was alright, food good, and the service also okay but they chatted in the galley most of the flight and didn't serve drinks. They were quite a cheerful bunch at least.

British Airways have gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactory. Not only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways, but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight, I only just boarded the aircraft on time. On both flights they ran out of one of the food options, leaving only the vegetarian dish. They onboard entertain system was low quality - a small screen with poor resolution. Seats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines I've flown in economy, Their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowance. I had connected from MIA to BOG with Avianca - they are a much better airline. Seats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality, and they had USB charging in economy.

The aircraft was fairly new (which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes we've flown on with BA). We'll ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint: having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane. As we didn't land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. We were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts! We complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of August. What a disgrace. We regularly fly BA and are silver card holders, however, we've decided to fly our next two long haul flights with Emirates. The BA planes we've flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality. What other airline expects you to climb over a strangers legs or to have a stranger climb over your legs to gain access to the aisle?

I was really surprised because there were a lot of passengers still at the gate and I was not the last one.

She said that the company will not compensate me anything because it is not the company's fault.  After what she said that I am not listening and she will cancel my next flight that BA transferred me to - BA 235. I asked why and she said that I should listen and then I'll understand. I listened again, but could not understand few things still. Why no one met me at the arrival if there was a risk of me being late. Why she admitted that the plane was full, so my place was given to someone else without asking me.

We finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. It was quite disgraceful for BA. Once airborne we were served tea / coffee / alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. Is this what BA has been reduced to?

I obviously complained, explaining exactly what the trip was and how we had specifically paid extra to ensure we were seated together as recommended on their website. Their response was simply that they could not guarantee seats due to operational or safety reasons - but wouldn't tell me why they had chosen to change our seats two weeks before (only that it was an operational reason). The customer services representatives were unhelpful, refusing to look at moving any individual travellers, staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful.

There was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customers. The meal served before landing was a choice between a mini Kitkat or a mini mars bar. A far cry from the scone, jam and cream of a couple of years ago - and even worse than the bruschetta, mini breadsticks, tomato salsa, packet of mixed nuts and 2 celebrations of a couple of months ago.

R Anderson,Aug-16,LHR to YUL,1.0,no respect for economy travellers,"Verified Review   I fly this route 3-4 times a year, unfortunately there is no competition other than Air Canada. I've had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfied. On this last flight a week ago, the plane has been internally reconfigured, and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 1/3 of the space, and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normal-sized adult. I have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - I offered to send BA this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint, see below. The discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours - for which I did not blame the airline - meaning I spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. Then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre-landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar, approximately 2 inches in size. As a result I arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would have brought food on the flight had I known of the miserly cost-cutting measure in advance. I wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration, as this can't easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. I ended my complaint saying I had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers. I've just received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint, indicating that it was not even read, and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy. Which is particularly shortsighted, as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances, and we won't forget how we were treated.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Positive,LHR,YUL

It would have been fine had I not paid top dollar for all the amenities. I submitted a complaint and asked for a partial $$$ voucher but to no avail. The customer service personnel told me things in conflict to documented conversations. The final straw was when I contacted my travel agent and had them call BA on my behalf. BA told them they would not refund anything because it was a voluntary upgrade. Really? BA changed my flight and rerouted me with less amenities.

BA denied me boarding because their system required not only me, but also the cello seat needs to have an ESTA visa! They were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system.

British Airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade, as they advise their responsibility is to get us from A to B. The entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price. Even though looking at their website they state ""personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones"" as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy.

Even less legroom than on a local flight to Europe (Ryanair) on a 10 hour flight. On the return journey the first flight from San Francisco to Heathrow was delayed. Once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy. So they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were. Very scary in view of the security situation. Then our row of 3 seats had no in-flight entertainment (row 28) The first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it. Then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink. So we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment. On landing at Heathrow our next flight to Aberdeen was also delayed for one hour. On complaining to BA they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds.

The business lounge was at least superior to the BA one I used on my outward journey, being independantly run. Our incoming flight for BA749 was delayed leaving Heathrow finally landing at 11.25PM. At 10:30pm passengers were informed by the business lounge Concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by 11:00pm as the airport closes at midnight so a rapid turnround was needed. The flight eventually pushed back from the stand at 23:50. I wonder if this was a ploy by BA to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delay.

The large glass panes afford a panoramic view of the surrounding area and a section of the runways. A good variety of food and drinks but hard to move around given the crowds. The bathrooms could do with more frequent cleaning. As for the flight, it left and arrived on time. I was served a cold chicken salad (no choices) and a dessert and a selection of drinks were offered. The flight attendant servicing the business class section was solicitous. Pilot kept us informed of weather and flight direction. A large monitor in the cabin revealed and updated the flight route. For a relatively short flight, service was fine. True the seats were not larger, nor was leg space more but the middle seat had been covered by a tray and thus empty.

Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations, and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. Seat very uncomfortable. Little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front. The only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew.

We arrived very early at the airport in Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight to London in premium economy. They would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. It is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers.

However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. The food offered in the CE cabin was delicious. Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. I had done my online check in on my return flight. Just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. The check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. She checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn't bother. When I was queuing up at the passport control, I noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had cleared through security. BA staff were shocked that I was checked in under someone else's name. Wrong name, Wrong flight etc. They asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY.

Flight from Manchester to Heathrow delayed for over 2 hours, very crowded waiting area. We had paid extra for emergency exit seats chosen before departure (only available exactly 14 days before flight). This was well worth the money paid. The emergency exit seats meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of us, giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight. Again we had paid extra for upgraded meals and these were very good quality, well presented with proper cutlery, also served before the rest of the cabin enabling us to then stretch out and relax. Good entertainment system. All the advantages of premium economy without the price. We had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meals as these are only available from Heathrow. Dont know why it's not available both ways as the meal is basically what they serve in first class. Having used Virgin to fly to Jamaica for last 9 years are now going with BA into Kingston, hoping the service is as good.

Deborah Jones,May-16,NAS to LHR,2.0,service is simply terrible,"In April my husband and I had booked business class seats from Bermuda to London on British Airways. The flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next day in premium economy and to date, two months later, no refund or compensation. We are gold card members and fly to London business class about 12-14 times a year. The service from Customer Relations is absolutely unbelievable. Last September I had glass in my foot on a flight from Bermuda to London as a result of flight crew dropping drinking glasses and not cleaning up properly. No compensation. British Airways has the monopoly on flights from Bermuda to London and the service is simply terrible. What really bothers me is that no one cares from British Airways, and I have no idea of where to lodge a complaint.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Negative,Negative,NAS,LHR
B Phelp,Jun-16,AGP to LGW,2.0,customer service the worst going,"Verified Review   I think that British Airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going, but that is their only achievement. Having booked our flight from Alicante to Gatwick I immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of €23 each. When I came to check in online, 24 hours before the flight, I found that we had been moved to row 30, the very back of the plane. When I selected 'Change your Seat' row 4 was not even displayed. I am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. For this reason I am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not and have not received any notification from BA to tell me they had changed the seating. Nor have I received my money back. While waiting to board the plane I received a text message survey on my BA experience so far. I participated and gave a summary of the situation. I also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. When I got home I gave BA one day to contact me but when they did not I submitted a complaint through their website. After some days I got a reply saying: 'Would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? We’ll be more than happy to see if you’re eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight'. I cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. But with BA you have to 'claim' a refund and then wait while they 'check your eligibility'. My family take many flights each year including long hauls to Asia. Needless to say that none of these will ever be on British Airways.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,AGP,LGW
Sandra Schofield,Jun-16,LHR to MCI via ORD,1.0,not an uncommon occurrence,"Verified Review   At the beginning of the year I booked 4 first class seats London-Kansas USA for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. At that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. At check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. After some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. At security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. Security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. When I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn't keep quiet. Once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and I requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. It arrived but I was told I could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. The flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. The staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. On talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. I had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. In the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and I was allowed to accompany her all the way. To add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. My mum refuses to fly BA again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to Virgin and other carriers. I have complained to BA but as of yet no response.",Family Leisure,First Class,[],Negative,Neutral,LHR,MCI via ORD
K Johnson,Jun-16,LAS to LHR,3.0,did not have a good experience,"Las Vegas to London Heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with British Airways. Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever. The entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. A few decent movies but not much else.

We arrived at BA's check in desk at 6am for our 9am flight, hoping to just drop our bags and relax until take off. When we arrived at check in we were advised the flight had been over booked and we would have to go on stand by. When we asked how can this be, we were advised by a manager that all airlines do this and check the small print. We stated as these flights had been bought and paid for over 6 months previous, so wanted to know how BA could re sell our seats, manager just kept repeating company policy. Manager stated we had to stay on stand by. As things turned out we did get stand by seats at the very last minute.

This is a recently introduced non-stop route - offers a reasonable price for Club Class until you add the seat reservation charge which added a further £68 to each seat each way to the overall charge. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours at Gatwick while we waited for someone senior to sign off the repairs / fault. On the return journey the flight took off 1 hour late - no explanation and then when we arrived at Gatwick we stood for 1 hour for our luggage to appear while other flights around us arriving later collected theirs.

M Parler,May-16,GVA to INV via LHR,3.0,not better service than EasyJet,"Verified Review   After a hiatus of almost 20 years, the Heathrow to Inverness route was reinstated in May 2016. For the last few years travelling to Inverness from Geneva we have been using Easyjet via Gatwick so I thought it would be interesting to see how BA compares to its budget rival when travelling to the North of Scotland. Overall, I would say not particularly favourably. Bag-Drop; I checked-in online so just had to go through bag-drop. However, with only one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passengers (versus 3 agents for business passengers) BA bag-drop in Geneva was a slow and painful experience and slower than I have recently experienced with Easyjet in Geneva.  Boarding in Geneva was fairly smooth, no better or worse than Easyjet. In-flight Staff were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast (of a ham and cheese croissant) could best be described as awful (a croissant in name only!). Given the price premium my overall opinion is that BA are not providing sufficiently better service in comparison to Easyjet considering the price premium between the two airlines.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,['May'],Positive,Negative,GVA,INV via LHR

It was so small you had to squint most of the time to make out what was going on, and the resolution was terrible and irritated the eyes. The screen had little crosses in it. This must have been an ancient plane. The movie selection was old given that I watched the same movies 2 months earlier. Nothing that is currently in the cinema. We only had one meal and when we asked for additional food there were only snacks in form of chocolate bars and biscuits.

Graham Pierce,May-16,MXP to LHR,1.0,no systems in place to cope,"Milan Malpensa to London Heathrow with British Airways. 1.25 hrs standing in queue to check in due to ""new system installed last month running slow"". So why no extra staff to cope with this? Plane then cancelled 30 mins after time, due to technical issue. No systems in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done. Everyone had to re-claim baggage, exit via passport control and queue at service desk to re-book. Unbelievably, desk staffed by only one person. People with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be re-planned but each of these took 10 to 15 mins to process, with a line of 100+ people waiting behind. Thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue, meaning that the queue was effectively not moving. Over 3 hours later a third of the queue was still standing in line waiting to be processed. It was only the self-discipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos. Why not two terminals so the onward travellers could be dealt with separately from those with simple needs? Why no seating and no queue management system? Pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem. Then had to re-present to re-check-in again via their slow 'new system' and go again through security (mercifully top class) and passport control for evening flight.

A Golding,Mar-16,LHR to BOM,5.0,poor customer service,"Verified Review   My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. The redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. Big mistake. Since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. Here is the reply we received from BA customer relations: ""We've received a reply from Mumbai who've investigated your case. The agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. He did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. He also mentioned BA wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" This is an outright lie. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. Poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,LHR,BOM

The gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink, to which she replied ""if you want another drink you'll have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself as I have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drinks for you"".

G Seeter,May-16,LHR to EWR,1.0,not be flying BA again,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Newark. Two evenings prior to my flight I used British Airways Android app to reserve extended legroom seats for my wife and me. At the time, advance reservation of regular seats was $51 and $59 for front-section extended legroom seats. I had no interest in reserving a regular seat (I could wait until 24 hours before check-in for that) but I was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats. So I paid the $118 for the two front-section seats. When my wife and I boarded the craft, lo and behold, the seats were not front-section seats at all! I was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my Android Phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely, apologizing to us, offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of post-flight. However, subsequent to the flight, British Airways has been positively nasty in their response, claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued (true enough) and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front-section when they were not. The fact that I received zero goods or services for my $118 beyond what I was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them. They have managed to bilk me out of $118 and having gotten their hands on my money, they intend to keep it. We'll see what my credit card company has to say about this, but it would be a lot smoother if we could simply settle this amicably, rather than forcing me to dispute the charge with my credit card company.

We were lucky and got row 2 by the food galley which meant extra legroom but that was more luck than design. I wouldn't fly Club Europe again unless I was guaranteed this seat but to get it I would have to pay £18 per person each way on top of the club fares. Total rip off BA. Before we flew I was going to book British Airways to Bangkok. Based on this experience though I'll stick to EVA Air. Additionally the club lounge at Gatwick was dire. No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to BA and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge.

S Williams,May-16,LYS to LHR,1.0,journey was chaotic and stressful,"Verified Review   British Airways have seriously gone downhill. There is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - I would actually prefer easyjet and Ryanair as at least they are transparent. This journey from Lyon to London Heathrow was chaotic and stressful. Thanks to BA charging £30 to check in luggage one way, every passenger takes cabin baggage. This means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. The boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - I have honestly never seen anything like it. Once on board, they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn't fit. Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. The meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwich. As always with BA flights to and from LHR, this flight was late. We ended up flying round and round over London for 30 mins. The worst thing is BA's new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening 24 hours before. This means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay £12 just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom). BA's new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process). A shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost. I will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,LYS,LHR

O Portich,Dec-15,TXL to PHL via LHR,3.0,I will no longer fly with BA,"Verified Review   Berlin to Philadelphia via London Heathrow. I've traveled with British Airways many times, and always thought it was a decent airline and preferred it for my trips back to Philadelphia over some of the other airlines. However this last trip has changed my mind and I will no longer fly with BA. We were given misprinted tickets for our connecting flight in LHR which led to us missing our flight - despite showing our tickets to several BA employees. We rushed to the gate printed on our tickets, where the woman at the counter informed us our flight was departing from A10 the terminal where we had just come from. We had to run with all our carry-on luggage and winter clothing the distance the train normally takes you! Upon reaching A10, we saw it's actually sub-divided in sections: A10 a, b, c, etc. This caused even more confusion - at first it took us the wrong way. Of course when we finally found the correct gate the flight was already gone. The BA employee at the gate apologized and told us to require to be rebooked because ""the problem was the fault of his colleague"". At the customer service counter, they also admitted the mistake, and pointed it out to a colleague who also agreed they had never seen this kind of error before. Another woman in line behind us, had the same issue and missed the same flight for the same reason. The customer service woman did her best for us and gave us new tickets but for a much later flight, and advised us write you in order to ""follow it up"". When we did try to ""follow it up"" I was sent a response that was clearly cut and pasted with errors and typos and did not address the issue of my complaint. I tried to call a few times to speak to an agent in person, but ended up waiting for close to an hour and having to pay several euros. Customer service was terrible and I can't imagine how it would have been if there was a more serious issue. Aside from this, the flights were cramped and the entertainment system was outdated - small screen with a poor selection and you have to hit your finger hard against the screen to get it to work. Not to mention, the beginning of our flight (way back) until after the food was served the system was out-of-order. The last complaint is about the airline food. As a vegetarian, normally I like BAs food but this time it was a joke. My ""special"" meal consisted of considerably less food than my boyfriend who had the regular meal. The pasta was one of the worst I've had on flight, and when breakfast came around, I got a recycled fruit cup from my dinner, while everyone else received a full box of food!

I had not heard from them by 6pm and was told to wait until they contacted me. I then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. So I specifically stayed home that night And finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep. I woke up and called British Airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as I got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. They said to call the courier company. I then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that Late at night. They then said the driver had a late night so wouldn't arrive until lunch time that day. so I went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. I then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. I called to see if I could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way. They said no, and that I would have to wait at my apartment for two hours and to call at 6pm if my bag had not arrived. This was ridiculous. I am so lucky my air BnB hosts supplied me with towels and a toothbrush and that I had money to go out and buy clothes for the day. So unimpressed with British Airways and their disorganisation with my bag.  I understand bags are lost but to be told that it was coming at three different times and also the fact that British Airways decided it had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company was a joke.

To start, the plane was dirty, excessive hand luggage allowances meant delays to boarding, the food was awful, leg room was non existent (I'm only 5'6), subzero temperatures during the flight and an inadequate ratio of toilets to passengers left me very uncomfortable. The positives were that staff were friendly and courteous under difficult circumstances and they didn't bother forcing us to endure the safety walk through. For a 6 hour direct flight at just over £500 this was the cheapest I could find.

Comfortable seat, nice entertainment. But the ground service was terrible - we were the first flight of the day and the clerks at the counter arrived to find 20-30 of us standing in queue. They got their stuff ready to work, sat in their chairs, then just sat their and ignored us for 15 minutes or so. The cabin crew didn't win any awards for friendliness either - they did their job but I won't say much more. The food served was adequate at best. This was my second time flying British Airways, and I have not been impressed either time. There are better choices.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,FCO,LHR

Arthur Kay,Apr-16,LHR to PHL,1.0,cares nothing for its passengers,"Verified Review   London to Philadelphia. Having booked business class and paid the non refundable fee, British Airways would not let me check in on line. When I reached Terminal 5 they bumped me due to overbooking. They offered me a downgrade that I could not accept for health reasons. If they had told me they were overbooked when I tried to check in online, I could have rerouted via New York and still arrived in time for an important meeting. As it was, I arrived 7 hours late and missed my meeting. British Airways only cares about maximising its profits. It cares nothing for its passengers. I have been a loyal customer of BA for over 50 years. For many years I was a gold card holder and this is how they treat me. They sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after I had paid the full and non refundable fare. They used to be good. their strapline, ""The World's Favourite Airline"" was not far from the truth. No longer! They are rapidly becoming the world's least favourite airline",Business,Business Class,[],Positive,Positive,LHR,PHL
Wayne Williams,Apr-16,YVR to BCN via LHR,2.0,a very uncomfortable flight,"Verified Review   Vancouver to Barcelona via Heathrow with British Airways. I would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews I've taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativity. This however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that I'm taking time to write this before we've even completed our round trip with British Airways, to be more direct I'm writing this on our final connector flight to Barcelona. On February 24th, 2016 I purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from Vancouver, Canada to Barcelona, Spain. This was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. Naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a Barcelona FC match. Even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  April 16th, 1 day before our trip I receive a email labeled ""updated travel itinerary."" When I opened the email, our flights no longer included our flight from Vancouver to Barcelona, actually they only had a return flight from Barcelona on April 27th. As I had got home late on April 16th from Cuba, I couldn't contact anyone until early morning of April 17th (my Fiance's birthday). Convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. Upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been ""cancelled"". We tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and I follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sense. We decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. This began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read ""submitting"" for roughly 30-60 minutes each time, never one actually submitting. We decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at YVR. The agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. She put a note on our file that an agent from Jacksonville BA had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. We asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn't available to us. We asked for access to the BA lounge while we waited, we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. After a very uncomfortable flight to Heathrow we spoke to an agent there, who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, which unfortunately still wouldn't get us the day we missed back). She went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. That was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. While we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats. We are now trying to make jokes out of the fact of if we will ever get home.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Negative,YVR,BCN via LHR
N Rawler,Apr-16,LHR to CPT via JNB,2.0,deeply distressing flight ,"Verified Review   I am writing to complain about my deeply distressing British Airways flight from London Heathrow - Cape town with a change at Johannesburg. The flight was badly managed throughout. when I arrived at Heathrow, I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. She eventually found it, She then said 'oh Im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight.' I was obviously distressed by this as imagined I would have to return back to Dorset? However, after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat. I arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to Johannesburg. However we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport. In this time, there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane. Once on the plane, again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that 'Sorry for the inconvenience, but BA did not have enough time to the the engineering works, or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day.' So we were extremely late in setting off from Heathrow. I think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. I was concerned about catching my next flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. The flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg. However, this could not have been further from the truth. Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight. She then pointed at a man (he was wearing no uniform) saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. We literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip? I gave him £5 but was extremely suprised that I would have to 'tip' someone who supposedly BA advised me to go withOnce getting to the gate and (just in time) the lady at Comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets, and rudely shouted at me as to 'Why? did you leave your luggage' By this point I had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. She then told us to 'just go back' with no further help. Luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the BA check in desk to ask for new tickets to Cape Town. Once at the BA deskthey were not helpful in the slightest. They simply told me to go and get my luggage from a 'Menzies' which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. I ran too and fro the Menzies (lost luggage) to the Comair and BA office - back and forth for around 2 hours. No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,LHR,CPT via JNB
D Rigby,Jan-16,GIB to LHR,2.0,worse than Ryanair or EasyJet,"Verified Review   Cancelled a British Airways flight to Gibraltar within cooling off period, they advised refund takes 24 hrs. Many calls later still no refund. Promised on 11 April would get refund within 72 hours. As of 15 April BA can’t say when will be refunded. Payment due 17 April  for replacement BA flight booked after first flight was cancelled and need refund to pay balance. BA don’t care, holding £353 and won’t say when it will be refunded. Loyal customer for 28 years. Appalling customer service and BA say if payment due on 17th April not made for replacement booking it will be cancelled and I will lose £150 deposit despite the fact they are keeping £353 of my money and have lied repeatedly as to when it will be refunded. BA flights are now a nightmare, last 3 flights travelled on were delayed due to hand baggage only passengers marauding up and down the aisle trying to stuff oversize hand luggage into overhead lockers with no care or consideration for other passengers possessions. Captain had to announce unless people sat down and allowed hand baggage to be placed in hold, plane would be further delayed. British Airways needs to decide whether it wants to be a no frills airline or not, it is now worse than Ryanair or Easyjet. Not a pleasant experience to fly BA anymore. Despite having problems of one type or another on nearly every booking made with BA in the last few years, continued to be loyal to them but they do not appreciate customer loyalty despite their recorded customer services message claiming they want to maintain high standards after travel and wish to ensure a passenger flies with BA again, they fail on all counts.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Negative,GIB,LHR

BA's Club Europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in Economy, which may be okay for a quick hop to Paris, but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight. It was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1 - the only row with reasonable leg room. Service was fine and the food quite good, but no entertainment at all.

I spent a considerable amount of time in Jan and Feb, booking these seats, and I had to pay over £70 for the privilege. BA systems were not working properly and I had to get phone help - to find the cause, but at the 15th attempt, I managed to book the seats. I like a window seat, mid cabin, in a number that divides by 3. Our flight was called, I went to the gate, with people behind me. The bar code on the bag drop issued boarding pass wouldnt scan. He asked his colleague who had other boarding passes, that still wouldnt scan. His other colleague thought it might be my passport and went off to check. I made the point that I had been in the airport three hours so if there was something wrong, surely they could have contacted me? The colleague came back. The bar codes still wouldnt scan and I heard one of them say 'they are already through'. I said I had booked a window seat for hubby and hoped the new one was. He said they were but by their numbers I could see they werent. Got on board. There was someone already in those seats!! I found an attendant, who went off and found us two seats. No window, across the aisle from the loo. So all night we heard the loo flushing and got bumped by people waiting and falling about due to turbulence. That would be why they were free.  I did look to where my booked seats were. There was a family of five in that row, that obviously wanted to be together. So though I was in a different bit of the cabin that might have been premium economy, as I was offered a hot flannel and some warm fizzy win in a plastic glass, I was certainly not upgraded. Doesn't matter if you pay for seat reservations, 6 weeks in advance. If somebody comes along later they'll turf you into cattle class.

We did get to London, the staff were great at helping us transfer to the 5B terminal to get the flight to Paris. But I noticed that by the time we would get to Paris, we would have missed the last shuttle bus to Disney. I mentioned this to the crew, who were very good at helping, realising that I was travelling with a young adult with learning disabilities. During the flight, one member of crew kept me updated. THere were some BA managers onboard as passengers. Before we landed, he came back and told me that one of the managers would get us through to the taxis and explain to the driver where we were going and ask for a receipt. (My french is minimal, so I'd have been lost) The manager told me to keep our boarding passes and receipt amd claim BA for the taxi. My son and i had a great weekend, got home and a couple of days later, I claimed for a refund. Alas, the computer said a big fat no. It was just bad luck that we'd had to rebook flights I explained that it was a BA manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to actually find out who flew on the flight. But still, no. Our insurance won't pay either because we didn't have a long enough delay! Ok, legally, BA may be in the right, but morally, well. Even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway. After all, we were delayed due to a cancelled flight - their fault. Usually BA are brilliant when we fly with them and I cannot fault any of the frontline staff. Just that blooming computer.

No other options and British Airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit 2 together on different rows. We kept the children together behind me, obviously meaning I could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone. Then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake - the attendents were unable to override the light - seriously.

Being a nervous flyer I was not up for sitting by myself for nearly 9 hours so we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage drop off point, the gentleman working behind the drop off was as helpful as he could be, but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left Punta Cana, and that it wasn't likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers. Getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane, with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay, flight attendants then offered us drinks - once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for and we were happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. But then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staff's family were on board and they were all staying in Punta Cana for 5 days before flying home. One member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class - and walked past everybody else. My partner then asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them. When we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water. 1 hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. All staff in our cabin looked half asleep, with hair all over the place. Considering this was a 2pm flight you'd have thought it was an evening flight. We arrived in Punta Cana at 7pm extremely disapointed with the poor service and the dated plane we had endured for almost 9 hours.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Positive,LGW,PUJ
John Davey,Dec-15,LHR to JNB,2.0,a very poor experience,"London to Johannesburg return with British Airways. This was my first ever long haul flight to see my daughter get married in Zimbabwe. I was in for a big shock and not a nice one. The seats and room were not really any different to low cost airlines and this was an 11 hour flight - jammed in like sardines and got no sleep. Freezing cold aircon all the way back from Johannesburg, and again so cramped that when the person in front of you puts the seat back, you cannot eat your food. I used a connecting flight to Bulawayo which was with South African Airlink and even though it was only a 1 hour flight, the food was much better and the plane far more comfortable. A very poor experience with British Airways and GBP 4000 spent for the 3 of us to get there and back. I will never be disapointed with Ryanair or easyjet again.

James Cohen,Dec-15,New York to London,1.0,entirely unsympathetic,"I booked a non-refundable round trip ticket, New York to London; Paris to New York. I showed up at JFK 2 hours before my flight and was informed that my ticket had been ""refunded,"" which meant I had no ticket. When I spoke to British Airways customer service, they said they would investigate how this happened, which would take 24-48 hours, but that meanwhile I had no ticket. They would not rebook my ticket. They were entirely unsympathetic, even though they had made a huge error cancelling my ticket. I was forced to purchase an expensive ($1300), last minute ticket, for which I have still not been reimbursed, even though, finally, British Airways acknowledged that they had made a big error. I can understand making an error. I cannot understand their unwillingness to help me, when they put me in such a compromised position. Subsequent to the problem on first leg, British Airways Customer Service assured me that my return ticket was not affected, and they even sent me an E-Ticket confirmation of my return. But, again, the morning of my return flight, they told me I had no return ticket. Only then did a Supervisor finally admit that an error had been made, and he rebooked my return, at no cost. Over the course of 2 weeks, however, I spent at least 10 hours trying to get my problem sorted out, first at Heathrow Airport, then on the phone and on email, and I was still left stranded for my return flight. I am amazed that British Airways was so insensitive to the problem which they created through a huge error, and that I have still not received a refund for the outbound ticket I was forced to purchase.",Business,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,New York,London
Robert Overbury,Oct-15,Gatwick to Las Vegas,4.0,last time I will fly British Airways,"This was and will remain the first and last time I will fly British Airways. Having flown this route numerous times before with a popular UK based airline I thought I would try BA. I expected a comparable experience at least, whilst hoping for something a cut above. On the outbound flight we were offered orange or champagne, the return flight was orange juice or water but only half the cabin was served so we didn't get anything. Outbound menu did not correspond with the food on offer and the choice of meal soon became no choice at all as halfway through serving the cabin section of 32 seats they ran out. At least on the return flight they managed two thirds of the cabin section before the options dried up again. There was a number of very disgruntled passengers who wondered what exactly they paid extra for. A minor gripe was the toilet was right through the economy section which I'm sure got on those passengers nerves. Seats were ok but the quality of the media system was poor and the touch screen was unreliable and a number of them didn't work at all so more upset passengers. I gave up on mine and watched movies on my phone, the quality was far superior. I had heard good things about BA however that was flying business/club or first class. Maybe that's what they concentrate on.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Neutral,Gatwick,Las Vegas

A Bhatia,Dec-15,PHX to LHR,5.0,we are disappointed,"Phoenix to London Heathrow, and this was our third time flying First Class on British Airways, and after flying this time, we are disappointed.  The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20 minutes. Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if I can find some biscuits for you"". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American accent for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. Toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical First Class amenities available within the toilets.

No attempt was made to separate passengers by row numbers onto the two buses used, as other airlines do in a similar situation, resulting in an absolutely chaotic boarding process. Cabin crew were off hand. The in flight snack was thrown at rather served to passengers.

Who wants to sit facing a fellow passenger for 11 hours? Terminal 5 Heathrow on departure is a disgrace. Surly staff on security and not a pleasant experience. The lounge was crowded, it was a Saturday, far too busy and not a relaxing environment. No Television to stop you getting bored. There are no warnings about how long it will take to get to your terminal. There are not enough boarding information screens to keep you updated. The flight was good and good crew.

E Davis-Bennett,Aug-15,JFK to London,3.0,BA really did not care,"I have flown British Airways Business Class and was pleased with Lounge, food service, Elemis Spa, showers wit Elemis products and on request champagne. Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. My review is for First only.",Solo Leisure,First Class,[],Positive,Negative,JFK,London

M Taylor,Jul-15,LHR to LAS,1.0,never going to fly them again ,"London Heathrow to Las Vegas with British Airways. Online check in and seat allocation facility 24 hours before departure are a con! I checked the available flight seats approximately 30 hours prior to check in and virtually 95% of the flight was pre-booked! Therefore, I panicked and prepaid the £70 to secure a window and middle seat as seats had not been allocated to me and wouldn't be until 24hours prior to check in. Then when I did check in approximately 23hrs and 59 minutes prior to travel I had already been allocated 2 seats, one by a window and one in the middle, so a total waste of time me paying £70. I got a refund, but only have the inconvenience of completing online forms and waiting around a month to get my money back. Then when I did get to the airport, the seats I had already paid the extra £70 for had been allocated to someone else (after I had paid for them)and they told me I had to sit in my original 2 seats that had been allocated - an utter farce! British Airways refused to acknowledge their systems were at fault and had use of my funds for almost a month yet had I been advised of my seats prior to check in I would not have paid them £70. They knowingly do this to encourage people to pre-pay for something they knowingly cannot deliver. The aircraft was dirty when we boarded as the fight was late, the toilets were blocked around 10 minutes into the flight and stank - eventually they were blocked off from use, which left 2 out of 4 toilets for the entire rear section of the plane.  The food was abysmal. Afternoon tea on a transatlantic flight used to be pleasant, with scones, cream, jam and nice selection of sandwiches. Now it is a dried up roll and dried excuse of a cake.

Lynn Ting,Nov-15,London to Barbados,3.0,British Airways have lost the plot,"I think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The London to Barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. It started at Grantley Adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. We sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so I had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. There were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents I would presume. Next the food, abysmal! A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). Breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. I have travelled with British Airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from Singapore and Malaysia with British Airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. The cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. I asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. I did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance.

British Airways charge you just for selecting a seat. Not a better seat, just any seat other than that automatically selected for you! The system seems designed to deliberately place you apart, even though it knows that you are together. Then it charges you £18 per seat to change your seat. If neither you or your partner have an empty seat next to you then you have to pay to move both seats just to be together. They also won't let you checkin until 24 hours before so you have to spend one hour of your holiday going online and paying for the privilege of sitting together. Both these practices are archaic, even with Ryanair, they place you together in the system and if you pay to change you get priority boarding. Monarch only charge you to get a better quality seat.

Erin Methered,Nov-15,DFW to DEL via LHR,1.0,way British Airways handled this was atrocious,"I was among the several hundred passengers whose British Airways flight was canceled last night from Dallas Ft Worth to London. No status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate, once the decision was made. They were not updated. People were told to call 1-800-AIRWAYS for help, but were turned away by the phone system, and as a result lost their places in line. One woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system, only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby, she had to go back and wait in line. Only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers, and each passenger took over 20-30 minutes to help, on average. One couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. They were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. The couple will now miss half their cruise. No screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights (like that couple or myself) close to the front of the line. There were two other flights out to LHR that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour, but due to the disorganization of the help, I missed both, even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. I was still in time to make the last flight out at 10:10pm, but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. People were falling out of line because there was no area to rest, or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. The customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. No attempt to ""take a number"" and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. Not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate. The way British Airways handled this cancellation was atrocious! Things break, including airplanes, which is understood, but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. I am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. I will now miss the first, and arguably most anticipated, part of my tour to India, and my traveling companion (coming from Atlanta) will be there alone, which is not safe for a young, single female. This airline has cost me time, money, and most importantly safety, for myself and my friend.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,DFW,DEL via LHR
J Griffiths,Oct-15,London to Delhi,3.0,try to avoid BA in the future,"Shameful service from British Airways travelling from Heathrow to Delhi. A problem with seat I had booked and paid extra for, ground staff said they had no authority - lots of phone calls nothing achieved, suggested I spoke with crew, understanding but pretty lack luster. A few crew members just rude. Food bad, service little better, seems to be a problem with allowing passengers a basic such as water. British Airways need to be shaken out of their tauper. Most other airlines far superior. Cabin very untidy, washroom not kept supplied. Sorry to say but nothing to commend here.

Denis Savostiyanov,Sep-15,Heathrow to Moscow,1.0,treatment was appalling,"My mother's flight from London to Moscow was cancelled. While understanding that these things happen, and accepting this inconvenience, it is the customer service of British Airways that I found outrageous. First of all, British Airways would refuse to speak to me (paying customer), as they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase details - despite the fact that I had any proof they may need, and all contact details in the ticket purchase data were mine. But fair enough, there is more. They couldn't speak to my mother (she doesn't speak English, they don't speak Russian), and while I was trying to offer various options to customer service agents, time passed. By the time (several hours later) I suggested their Moscow office calls my mother to confirm her identity, it was too late - Moscow office was closed, and all was offered is for my mother to call then next day. Needless to say, she had to travel next day, and it was unacceptable option. So, At no point my mother was offered anything required by Regulations 261/2004, Articles 8, 9 and 14 - so BA appears to be in breach of those regulations. I bought a ticket for my mother with Aeroflot instead, for a flight at a similar time to that cancelled by BA, and asked BA for refund. BA in turn (and after my mother travelled to Moscow) demanded a letter of authority from her, otherwise they would refuse to speak to me. They would not, for example, call my mother in Moscow and simply ask her.  My mother sent me letter of authority, which I forwarded to the BA. Now they would speak to me, and promised refund and compensation. This was on 30th September 2015. On 20th October 2015, (20 days after - Regulations state that refund must be made within seven days) I chased this with BA. I was promised a refund and compensation again. As of today (6 November 2015), nothing was paid to me yet. Customer service responds with generic messages, themed ""We are sorry for the delay, the refund will be with you soon"". My requests are simply ignored. So, while it might be a reasonably comfortable airline when everything works well, I would encourage everyone to very seriously consider how you will be treated in an event of a delay or cancellation. In my experience, the treatment was appalling.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,['may'],Negative,Negative,Heathrow,Moscow
Kath Boddy,Nov-15,Venice to Gatwick,9.0,dismayed by the BA agent,"Excellent flight and no complaints even though we were delayed due fog at Gatwick. The pilot kept us briefed as to what was going on and the cabin crew looked after us. I was however dismayed by the BA agent that dealt with our check in at Venice. We were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked us to go this woman, from the outset she was not happy. We were a party of 8 and she only wanted to check in 2. She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline. I feel BA need to know how their passengers are treated by agent staff. I have not included this experience in my rating of BA.

Amanda Russell,Oct-15,SSH to LGW,5.0,BA really need to address this,"I flew with British Airways for my family holiday to and from Sharm El Sheikh from London Gatwick. I checked in online both ways 24 hours before which was fine and all went well. However, I have a special dietary need and I was not able to click on this for the flight. With BA, you get meals, snacks and drinks included so I knew that we would have a meal with a 5 hour flight. While on board, I was able to choose the fruit option for breakfast on the way there - however on the way back it was a cold deli option which consisted of a wrap, a roll and some crackers. I asked if there was a gluten free option and the assistant said ""No just this"". Following this we could have pretzels and biscuits with a drink. Obviously someone like me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything with wheat/gluten so I was left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the crackers. BA really need to address this as it is not fair to advertise they provide meals on board when clearly there was nothing available for me. Luckily I always carry my own food with me and I did not starve. Also I didn't know why there was no inflight entertainment for such a a long flight.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,SSH,LGW
Phil Carter,Oct-15,LHR to Venice,9.0,very good flying experience,"LHR to Venice was on time, friendly cheerful crew and a very enjoyable plate of cold cuts, cheeses, warm rolls and fruit for breakfast, way better than any other breakfast I've had on a BA flight long or short haul. Seats comfortable, very enjoyable flight. The return leg, Barcelona to LHR had the same meal so was very happy plus a glass of wine as it was lunchtime. The standby crew member (who happened to be a purser) in business class was chatty, friendly and pleasant to everyone. He did his best to make up for his colleagues major shortcomings! The original designated purser for the flight on the other hand was well .. he plonked the meal down in front of you without uttering one word. The only words he spoke to the entire 24 passengers in the club section were 'do you want it or not'. He put the roll basket in front of everyone's nose but still did not utter one word. It was bizarre - I've never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passengers whatever class they were flying! He couldn't even be polite to his colleague with just a 'pass me some cokes' and that was that. Overall we had a very good flying experience with BA but I wont forget that purser and his attitude for a long time!",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Positive,LHR,Venice
K Riley,Sep-15,SFO to EDI via LHR,2.0,not helped by customer service,"San Francisco to Edinburgh via London with British Airways. Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we waited over an hour before we were informed, only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made, that our luggage was lost at Heathrow - along with 500 other bags. Things happen, and can be forgiven; it's what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. We were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. We were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. Since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through Scotland, we gave them the address of the B&B where we would be the following night, essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. We received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. They did not arrive. In the next seven days, I spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in India who were absolutely no help at all. The customer service phone line at BA was not being answered, and the supposed courier service phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of service as well. I emailed both the courier service and BA customer service and did not receive a response from either one. Still, the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. On the evening of the fifth day, it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line (in India) who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in Edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. The bags were continually listed as being out for delivery, but they never showed up. We were never contacted, and neither was the B&B where we had had them (supposedly) sent. On the morning of the sixth day, on yet another call to India, I stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that I was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. Then, in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the Edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there, that they had never been out for delivery at all. We would be in Tarbert on Harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. Seven days after our arrival in Edinburgh. During the seven days, we had to purchase clothes to wear. We missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with BA and the time spent shopping for clothes. When we made the return flight, we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. Finally, a month later, we have received a note of intended compensation from British Airways - for the amount of the clothing only. Not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn't have needed to buy or to check through, and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of British Airways. That's completely on them, and we should be reimbursed for the charges. One would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience, but nothing was offered.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,SFO,EDI via LHR

The attendant at the desk merely informed these passengers that the desk was closed and they should return tomorrow. It was 3.00 on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing was offered to help these passengers get to their final destination. After calling multiple times and sending various emails, I was ""granted"" a refund. My full refund offer came with a $50 cancellation fee and a $40 service fee. I have yet to accept the offer. We never cancelled her flight nor received anything that looks like service.

I was told I would have to pay 110.00 pounds ($232.99 Aus) so I could get the earlier flight. Because I had been travelling for so long and just wanted to get to Belfast I paid the money.

If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in Toronto on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other bags. They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem - after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up on the Hotel Manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4 - not a problem normally. but it had cost £90.00 extra to book these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Toronto

I have lost track of the numbers of flights I've taken over the years, on business in Europe and on holiday worldwide. With family in the US, regular flights have almost exclusively till now been with British Airways: some economy, some WTP, more recently in Business. Service, value etc has to now ranged from acceptable to good, occasionally excellent. Shame things seem to have changed. For our annual trip last December I booked my 7-year old daughter and myself on British Airways LHR to Chicago, returning from Washington Dulles to LHR. Both flights in Business Class. Booking process online reasonably good, with helpful assistance from a ""real person"" when there was a problem - which happened 3 times in the months before departure. No common sense used when flights are cancelled and ""suitable alternatives"" booked, when seats had been pre-purchased, when clearly travelling with a child. Check-in and departure were smooth. Travel in economy means that they feed children first. Travel in business and they serve children serve after the adults.  The ""child meal"" (when it eventually arrived) was a disgrace, I wouldn't feed it to an animal! Peas blackened, mash dried and crusty. Not surprisingly she didn't want it. Ended up eating my meal. Entertainment screen (essential for children and part of the treat of the journey) didn't work, so we swopped seats - so no entertainment screen for Mummy! Thank goodness I had my Kindle. No apologies from staff. More interested in the male business travellers. Return flight after Christmas from  Washington Dulles to LHR was slightly better. Evening meal available in lounge prior to boarding - providing you're an adult. Again nothing for children except some biscuits.

So, now I have a credit for one year with British Airways and I will have to deal with them again.  What a rip off.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,[],Negative,Negative,Istanbul,Denver via LHR

As my flight was delayed between JFK and Heathrow. I was appalled to see how badly immigration was dealt with and how little effort British Airways put into organising its customers. Some people where told to go to a service desk and cancel and rebook flights, while others got put in a fast track immigration queue. No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight. I would never recommend British Airways to anyone. They only care about premium paying passengers and the service they claim to offer has been left behind by other providers.

Kim Dollery,Aug-15,Miami to London Heathrow,3.0,British Airways customer review,"London to Miami return. Flew out with 5 children, one was an infant turning 2 during holiday. Had necessary booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me bookings were linked and there would be no issue. Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. My flight closed and took off without me - despite me constantly stressing that I had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. Long story short, I was dumped on next flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children, no explanation of what was going on - people being served all around me by person who was supposed to be dealing with me, no child meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. Resulted in me being stranded at Heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. I had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled 'heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos'. Had a further 3 hour wait at the other end as all medical assistance booked had not been transferred as requested.

TV not working for 1st hour, then when it did, couldn't hear it though the provided headphones, so had to choose film with subtitles. Although staff doing their jobs, the 3 near us seemed to have an attitude, a man behind asked for a cup of tea and the flight assistant muttered under his breath. My partially sighted mother asked politely for milk with her tea and the flight assistant, made her feel stupid by shoving it in her face and sarcastically saying ""there it is"". I realise she didn't know my mother was partially sighted, but maybe she should be aware that you can't always see people's disabilities.

The journey to St Lucia was pleasant enough as we were upgraded from economy to premium economy due to spare seats. Unfortunately however the upgrade meant that my husband and I no longer had seats together (as I has with the seats I'd pre-booked) and as this was our honeymoon this was quite important for us. The journey home however was extremely disappointing. On finding our seats we discovered that the plane had not been cleaned since the previous journey. There were empty sweet wrappers in the pocket and crumbs all over the seat and on the floor. We were not offered a new pillow and blanket and instead we're left the ones used by previous customers. In my case blanket scrunched up on floor with pillow on top. In comparison with other long haul flights we have travelled on with Virgin and Emirate,s British Airways seemed to provide much less space and poorer facilities. Needless to say the flight was an uncomfortable one for many reasons.

C O'Hanlon,Aug-15,LHR to BCN,9.0,British Airways customer review,"First time travelling in a premium class so compared with Economy it was great. Check-in at LHR was quick and we were grateful of the additional baggage allowance in Club Europe. The fast track through security was also welcome. The Galleries Lounge in T3 was excellent, we were welcomed and given a quick overview of the lounge. The breakfast in the lounge offered everything from cereal to pastries to hot sandwiches, as well as tea, coffee, juice, water and a wide selection of alcohol. There was also a great view of the runway which my son enjoyed. The service on board the flight itself offered hot towels prior to take off, then a full English Breakfast with real cutlery and plates, warm bread rolls and choice of drinks. The legroom was excellent and the seat was comfortable. They are laid out in the same 3x3 configuration as Economy but the middle seat has a table over it which gives you extra room to place your items. As you are near the front of the plane, disembarkation was quick and we were at the carousel before our cases. The return journey was much the same, and although the lounge at BCN did not offer anywhere near such a good selection of food, the seating was far superior to LHR. The meal on the way back was a selection of Spanish meats with, cheese, olives and a spicy mousse, together with the usual selection of drinks. We were able to use the Fast Track through passport control at LHR which avoided a long queue and meant we were out of the airport and in our car within an hour. Overall this was a fantastic experience for me and my family who usually travel in Economy.",Family Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,LHR,BCN

The experience at the airport was dreadful - initially told that we would be updated every 15 minutes (that was the only update!) stuck airside with no food (all food outlets and shops shut), a free for all when some bottles of water arrived. Inability of BA ground staff to communicate with immigration (a walk of about 6 feet or a phone call), chaos when trying to give immigration cards back to hot, tired, thirsty and hungry passengers. The positive in all this was being put up in a hotel. Again - lack of communication. I was never contacted directly - people in the group were updated by BA on twitter. great if you have internet/twitter.

Yvonne Attridge,Aug-15,London Gatwick to Rome Fiumicino,1.0,British Airways customer review,"What on earth has happened to British Airways inflight meals? On our way out to Rome, we were told that the plane had to be changed, so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it I thought well, OK, maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes so no hot meals available. However, on our return, not only did we have an hour delay (still not sure why that happened, we were traveling with a 1 year old baby, so it was quite stressful just waiting around), but on our flight our ""meal"" was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce, they said chicken was in it, but I didn't have any in mine. That was it, no hot drink either, the drinks trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink, or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling. I'm not a fussy person, but I thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot, I didn't have time to eat anything at the airport, and arrived home at midnight, I was starving.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London Gatwick,Rome Fiumicino

She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone, then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like tea and if all was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy. Previously I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline.

It is now nearly our fourth day on holiday and we still have not got our bags. I understand that this happens and sometimes is inevitable, but I am most dissatisfied by the information British Airways are able to provide us about our bags. All we know is that they have left Heathrow; we don't know which airport they were flown to, if they arrived, where they are or when we can expect them. They have no details of any individual bags and I think this is disgusting service.

I booked a flight to Florence through BA website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that I was flying with Vueling. Never heard of them. To cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours, nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally got there, one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left Italy yet. We informed the ground staff. They did not day a thing. After half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. I headed straight back the the terminal and sought a British Airways rep to try and get an answer, firstly because that is who I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no representation at the airport. I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't help. I explained the situation again and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer Service Representative' walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him. He looked at me as if I had 2 heads and in the end walked away after calling me an 'ar----le'. 100% true, in the middle of Gatwick North Terminal. My wife and 6 week old child were themselves waiting at Florence 4 hours for me. We were told Vueling were going to try and get us out the following day. But no guarantees. I booked another flight with British Airways to get to my family, and British Airways have offered nothing, not even an apology.

Donna Miller,Jul-15,Los Angeles to Milan via LHR,7.0,British Airways customer review,"Considering BA's fares were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our British son in law. Plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. We flew Premium Economy, seats are bigger and have leg room but they're not comfortable for some reason. Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets. But although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part. Not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. I guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all.

There was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. The outward journey was okay, flight attendant was pleasant. I think the meal choices could be improved - these tickets are not cheap. However the return flight (31/7/15) which was in economy - also not cheap, was not good at all. The attitude of the staff was really below par. The food choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. Seeing the choice I asked for the vegetarian option-Couscous with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  When asked would I like a drink I replied - Bloody Mary. I should have known better, as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through, produced the drink without any WS. I asked if I could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown.

No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service.

So on this flight I took advantage of a what I thought was a reasonably priced Club World ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch. Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit over customer service and I am amazed that anyone travels Club Europe. Later in the year I was due to travel to South America via Madrid in Business Class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline.

The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful.

Jenny Phan,Jul-15,JFK to TAV via LHR,5.0,British Airways customer review,"This was my first time with British Airways. I was disappointed in the amount of seat/leg room compared to some other airlines I've traveled with. I was also surprised that on longer European flights London to Istanbul for example which I traveled) there was no TV when the flight is as long or longer than flights in Asia from country-to-country which have TV/entertainment system. The universal entertainment system was broken too and the sound wasn't working. The service button to call an attendant was broken too. A stewardess on this particular flight from JFK to LHR (BA1511 on June 19, 2015) was so rude to my daughter. My daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food options on the plane included dairy. My daughter asked nicely if there was any non-dairy options and the stewardess, takes the food from my daughter’s tray and says “I guess you’re just going to have to eat that salad.” It wasn’t what she said that bothered me, it was the way she said it. She didn’t offer pretzels or non-dairy snacks or anything. This was my first experience with British Airways, and I was disappointed. It wasn’t until my flight back home that I felt a bit better. On my ride back with British Airways, not this flight in specific (from LHR to LAS), I encountered a steward who was very pleasant, polite and very professional.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,JFK,TAV via LHR
Benedict Hung,Jul-15,Toronto to Rome via London,1.0,British Airways customer review,"As a frequent flyer on various airlines, British Airways is by far the worst I have experienced. Substandard customer service even before the flight. My original plan was to fly from Toronto to Rome via London on July 2nd. Three tickets were purchased and confirmed in March. Two weeks before departure, an email was sent to me altering my flight from London to Rome. I called and waited on the service hotline - I was able to get myself on one flight and my parents on another. The rep refused to try to put me together with my parents. Less than 48 hours before departure my rescheduled flight was rerouted to Naples. The agent told me all extra travel expenses would be my own. On the day of departure I got my flight from Gatwick to Rome after rushing from Heathrow. I was told initially the flight was rerouted to Naples and just before departure this reverted back to a direct flight to Rome - very confusing communication. I arrived in Rome to discover my parents flight was delayed for four hours. With more BA flights arriving into the terminal, the service desk was closed before my flight even arrived. There are no BA reps anywhere to seek assistance.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Toronto,Rome via London
JinDao Zhou,Jun-15,Rotterdam to London,1.0,British Airways customer review,"My family and I flew from Rotterdam to London on 26th of June, and it's our first time traveling with BA. We chose it as we thought this airlines would be better than budget airlines with constant delays. We were very wrong. We arrived at the airport on time and sat down to wait. BA announced flight delays due to ""technical"" error for 1.5 hours before finally announcing that the flight was cancelled. We were given no explanation except for one phrase ""technical fault"". We were then unceremoniously sent back to queue in line to be rescheduled. We waited another 45 mins and was then transferred to a 7.20pm flight (original was 1.05pm). We were denied all chances to board an earlier one at 4pm. We did not complain or gave BA any trouble. We followed procedures and applied for compensation online. Their reply was simply a sorry and they denied all responsibilities.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Rotterdam,London
I Rodriguez,Jul-15,LHR to JFK  ,6.0,British Airways customer review,"My experience chimes with the general consensus on the Club World service LHR-JFK. Cabin, seats and fittings are showing their age and look rather shabby by this point. Not too clean, red wine spills on my foot rest when I boarded. Tiny screen and IFE looked dated, not great entertainment selection. The food quality was good but service from cabin crew was rather indifferent with little attempt to make it a special dining experience. Nuts and chocolates served in packets, not bowls. Not attentive over providing drinks refills or water. I wasnt offered all of the items listed on the menu - where did my fruit and cheese platter go? Had to ask for coffee/tea refills after the meal. Brewed coffee only - no fresh lattes/cappuccinos. Was not offered disgestifs after the meal. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal. Self service snacks in the galley were economy quality (apart from some nice rose champagne). Just not a luxury or experience! Felt like I was in economy but with more space and food.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,LHR,JFK  
Lee Bailey,Jun-15,Heathrow to Ibiza,1.0,British Airways customer review,"On this occasion my partner and I experienced a 3.5 hour delay with BA. There was no communication at the airport, nothing until we got onto the plane where the captain told us delays were due to a bag that had not been checked in correctly at Heathrow. Because of the delay when the plane finally arrived it had no water on board and was not permitted to fill up at our destination. This meant disgusting toilets because of no flush and no warm drinks on board. We were sat on the runway for an hour because the engines would not start. We had no aircon for 40 mins. When we finally got back to Heathrow the captain told us that he was sorry for the issues.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,Heathrow,Ibiza
Heather Worthington,Jun-15,Washington DC to Heathrow,3.0,British Airways customer review,"Our night flight was delayed by nearly an hour; not the fault of the airline but a contributory factor to our disappointment with BA on this flight (17th June 2015). We paid extra for our Premium Economy tickets, then extra again to reserve seats, and past experience with BA and with equivalent seats/service on Virgin Atlantic had led us to expect value for money and some small rewards for the extra costs. Not this flight, however, where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom. We were last to board after First, Business and Economy. Where customers in Premium Economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice, now it is water or juice. Once we had taken off, drinks were served; fine, but when the steward came to collect the empty glass/bottle, he knocked the glass onto the floor, where it broke - the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps? I was made to feel that the breakage was my fault! Dinner did not arrive until after 11pm, by which time I had rather lost interest, as had my partner. So far, our extra costs had bought us extra leg room and one glass of wine (I was not offered a second, possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass). Overnight, by contrast to other night flights, the lights were never fully dimmed; there were no offers of water/orange juice to prevent dehydration. The promised (on the menu card) morning 'light snack' and coffee/tea/fruit juice was a hastily delivered piece of dried-up cake and a weak coffee - no mention of fruit juice. I couldn't really see what my extra costs were getting me that those in Economy had for less - the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in front's fully reclined seat. I will not, if at all possible, be travelling with BA again. It left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,[],Positive,Neutral,Washington DC,Heathrow
Thomas Kingston,Nov-14,Vienna to London,3.0,British Airways customer review,After my flight to Vienna with BA I was hoping for a slight improvement on the way back - however the service was very boring. Drink service was rushed with the stewardess pouring an entire miniature of vodka into a drink before putting a drop of Tomato juice in when I asked for a Tomato and Vodka - unpalatable. Was glad to be off the plane in all fairness. Hoping that one day BA will wow me.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,Vienna,London
Thomas Kingston,Nov-14,London to Vienna,4.0,British Airways customer review,Slightly disappointing flight in an aircraft that was showing it's age. It seems very little effort is put into cabin decor meaning it looks quite tawdry in all fairness. Food was okay - ham and cheese croissant - but nothing to write home about. Seats weren't great for someone my height and all in all I was left feeling underwhelmed - budget level offerings at a high price,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Negative,Neutral,London,Vienna
C Barkei,Jun-15,LHR to LUX,8.0,British Airways customer review,"Short hop from the empty terminal 1 at LHR to LUX. Nice to be able to use the lounge in LHR, but an aggravating wait at security despite virtually no line. Excellent service on board, off the plane at LUX, through passport control and in the car in under 10 minutes. I was impressed with the cheerful nature of cabin staff.",Business,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,LHR,LUX
Michael Stanley,Jun-15,LHR to BKK,6.0,British Airways customer review,"LHR to BKK June 13th 2015 Club World (Business). While the aircraft is starting to show its age, seats were reasonably comfortable - as long as you don't mind the unusual seating configuration where some passengers travel facing backwards. Cabin service and food quality were good - with one of the best breakfasts we have had in the air - a delicious fruit muesli followed by a 'full english' which was hot and tasty. On this overnight flight, sleep was difficult mainly due to the narrowness of the seats. BA should provide a mattress 'topper' as many other airlines offer to enhance sleep comfort. Fair value for money proposition.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,[],Positive,Neutral,LHR,BKK
Nazira Khatun,Jun-15,London to Turkey,10.0,British Airways customer review,"I flew out on the 8th June 2015 and all I can say is that the staff, flight and service was excellent. We had a little issue with the flights as the people we booked it with made an error on our tickets but BA sorted this out in no time. I will definitely be flying out with them again and I will recommend them. Service on the plane was excellent.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,London,Turkey
Nur Afiqah Rahmat,Jun-15,Abu Dhabi to Muscat,9.0,British Airways customer review,"I fly with this airline almost every other weekend from Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Throughout (I think so far 7 trips with them), they have never had any delays with me, and even if there has been, it would be a maximum 30 minutes (and still be able to arrive in Muscat on time). Staff are professional, yet friendly enough to chat to. It would be excellent if there was a flight from Muscat to Abu Dhabi at an earlier time (the only ones available now is one that arrives at midnight). The only downside to this airline is that the Highlife shopping is not available for that Abu Dhabi - Muscat due to the short duration, even if you booked and paid for the items online and were hoping for an onboard delivery.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,[],Positive,Neutral,Abu Dhabi,Muscat
